# FastMCP v2 🚀

**The fast, Pythonic way to build MCP servers and clients.**

_Made with ☕️ by[Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/)_

[](https://gofastmcp.com) [](https://discord.gg/uu8dJCgttd) [](https://pypi.org/project/fastmcp) [](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml) [](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/LICENSE)

[](https://trendshift.io/repositories/13266)

Note

#### FastMCP 2.0: The Standard Framework

FastMCP pioneered Python MCP development, and FastMCP 1.0 was incorporated into the [official MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) in 2024.

**This is FastMCP 2.0** — the actively maintained, production-ready framework that extends far beyond basic protocol implementation. While the SDK provides core functionality, FastMCP 2.0 delivers everything needed for production: advanced MCP patterns (server composition, proxying, OpenAPI/FastAPI generation, tool transformation), enterprise auth (Google, GitHub, WorkOS, Azure, Auth0, and more), deployment tools, testing utilities, and comprehensive client libraries.

**For production MCP applications, install FastMCP:** `pip install fastmcp`

* * *

**FastMCP is the standard framework for building MCP applications** , providing the fastest path from idea to production.

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is a standardized way to provide context and tools to LLMs. FastMCP makes building production-ready MCP servers simple, with enterprise auth, deployment tools, and a complete ecosystem built in.
    
    
    # server.py
    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    
    mcp = FastMCP("Demo 🚀")
    
    @mcp.tool
    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        """Add two numbers"""
        return a + b
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        mcp.run()

Run the server locally:
    
    
    fastmcp run server.py

### 📚 Documentation

FastMCP's complete documentation is available at **[gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com)** , including detailed guides, API references, and advanced patterns. This readme provides only a high-level overview.

Documentation is also available in [llms.txt format](https://llmstxt.org/), which is a simple markdown standard that LLMs can consume easily.

There are two ways to access the LLM-friendly documentation:

  * [`llms.txt`](https://gofastmcp.com/llms.txt) is essentially a sitemap, listing all the pages in the documentation.
  * [`llms-full.txt`](https://gofastmcp.com/llms-full.txt) contains the entire documentation. Note this may exceed the context window of your LLM.



**Community:** Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/uu8dJCgttd) to connect with other FastMCP developers and share what you're building.

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets you build servers that expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. It is often described as "the USB-C port for AI", providing a uniform way to connect LLMs to resources they can use. It may be easier to think of it as an API, but specifically designed for LLM interactions. MCP servers can:

  * Expose data through **Resources** (think of these sort of like GET endpoints; they are used to load information into the LLM's context)
  * Provide functionality through **Tools** (sort of like POST endpoints; they are used to execute code or otherwise produce a side effect)
  * Define interaction patterns through **Prompts** (reusable templates for LLM interactions)
  * And more!



FastMCP provides a high-level, Pythonic interface for building, managing, and interacting with these servers.

## Why FastMCP?

FastMCP handles all the complex protocol details so you can focus on building. In most cases, decorating a Python function is all you need — FastMCP handles the rest.

🚀 **Fast:** High-level interface means less code and faster development

🍀 **Simple:** Build MCP servers with minimal boilerplate

🐍 **Pythonic:** Feels natural to Python developers

🔍 **Complete:** Everything for production — enterprise auth (Google, GitHub, Azure, Auth0, WorkOS), deployment tools, testing frameworks, client libraries, and more

FastMCP provides the shortest path from idea to production. Deploy locally, to the cloud with [FastMCP Cloud](https://fastmcp.cloud), or to your own infrastructure.

## Installation

We recommend installing FastMCP with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):
    
    
    uv pip install fastmcp

For full installation instructions, including verification, upgrading from the official MCPSDK, and developer setup, see the [**Installation Guide**](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/installation).

**Dependency Licensing:** FastMCP depends on Cyclopts for CLI functionality. Cyclopts v4 includes docutils as a transitive dependency, which has complex licensing that may trigger compliance reviews in some organizations. If this is a concern, you can install Cyclopts v5 alpha (`pip install "cyclopts>=5.0.0a1"`) which removes this dependency, or wait for the stable v5 release. See [this issue](https://github.com/BrianPugh/cyclopts/issues/672) for details.

## Core Concepts

These are the building blocks for creating MCP servers and clients with FastMCP.

### The `FastMCP` Server

The central object representing your MCP application. It holds your tools, resources, and prompts, manages connections, and can be configured with settings like authentication.
    
    
    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    
    # Create a server instance
    mcp = FastMCP(name="MyAssistantServer")

Learn more in the [**FastMCP Server Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/fastmcp).

### Tools

Tools allow LLMs to perform actions by executing your Python functions (sync or async). Ideal for computations, API calls, or side effects (like `POST`/`PUT`). FastMCP handles schema generation from type hints and docstrings. Tools can return various types, including text, JSON-serializable objects, and even images or audio aided by the FastMCP media helper classes.
    
    
    @mcp.tool
    def multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float:
        """Multiplies two numbers."""
        return a * b

Learn more in the [**Tools Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/tools).

### Resources & Templates

Resources expose read-only data sources (like `GET` requests). Use `@mcp.resource("your://uri")`. Use `{placeholders}` in the URI to create dynamic templates that accept parameters, allowing clients to request specific data subsets.
    
    
    # Static resource
    @mcp.resource("config://version")
    def get_version(): 
        return "2.0.1"
    
    # Dynamic resource template
    @mcp.resource("users://{user_id}/profile")
    def get_profile(user_id: int):
        # Fetch profile for user_id...
        return {"name": f"User {user_id}", "status": "active"}

Learn more in the [**Resources & Templates Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/resources).

### Prompts

Prompts define reusable message templates to guide LLM interactions. Decorate functions with `@mcp.prompt`. Return strings or `Message` objects.
    
    
    @mcp.prompt
    def summarize_request(text: str) -> str:
        """Generate a prompt asking for a summary."""
        return f"Please summarize the following text:\n\n{text}"

Learn more in the [**Prompts Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/prompts).

### Context

Access MCP session capabilities within your tools, resources, or prompts by adding a `ctx: Context` parameter. Context provides methods for:

  * **Logging:** Log messages to MCP clients with `ctx.info()`, `ctx.error()`, etc.
  * **LLM Sampling:** Use `ctx.sample()` to request completions from the client's LLM.
  * **Resource Access:** Use `ctx.read_resource()` to access resources on the server
  * **Progress Reporting:** Use `ctx.report_progress()` to report progress to the client.
  * and more...



To access the context, add a parameter annotated as `Context` to any mcp-decorated function. FastMCP will automatically inject the correct context object when the function is called.
    
    
    from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context
    
    mcp = FastMCP("My MCP Server")
    
    @mcp.tool
    async def process_data(uri: str, ctx: Context):
        # Log a message to the client
        await ctx.info(f"Processing {uri}...")
    
        # Read a resource from the server
        data = await ctx.read_resource(uri)
    
        # Ask client LLM to summarize the data
        summary = await ctx.sample(f"Summarize: {data.content[:500]}")
    
        # Return the summary
        return summary.text

Learn more in the [**Context Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/context).

### MCP Clients

Interact with _any_ MCP server programmatically using the `fastmcp.Client`. It supports various transports (Stdio, SSE, In-Memory) and often auto-detects the correct one. The client can also handle advanced patterns like server-initiated **LLM sampling requests** if you provide an appropriate handler.

Critically, the client allows for efficient **in-memory testing** of your servers by connecting directly to a `FastMCP` server instance via the `FastMCPTransport`, eliminating the need for process management or network calls during tests.
    
    
    from fastmcp import Client
    
    async def main():
        # Connect via stdio to a local script
        async with Client("my_server.py") as client:
            tools = await client.list_tools()
            print(f"Available tools: {tools}")
            result = await client.call_tool("add", {"a": 5, "b": 3})
            print(f"Result: {result.content[0].text}")
    
        # Connect via SSE
        async with Client("http://localhost:8000/sse") as client:
            # ... use the client
            pass

To use clients to test servers, use the following pattern:
    
    
    from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client
    
    mcp = FastMCP("My MCP Server")
    
    async def main():
        # Connect via in-memory transport
        async with Client(mcp) as client:
            # ... use the client

FastMCP also supports connecting to multiple servers through a single unified client using the standard MCP configuration format:
    
    
    from fastmcp import Client
    
    # Standard MCP configuration with multiple servers
    config = {
        "mcpServers": {
            "weather": {"url": "https://weather-api.example.com/mcp"},
            "assistant": {"command": "python", "args": ["./assistant_server.py"]}
        }
    }
    
    # Create a client that connects to all servers
    client = Client(config)
    
    async def main():
        async with client:
            # Access tools and resources with server prefixes
            forecast = await client.call_tool("weather_get_forecast", {"city": "London"})
            answer = await client.call_tool("assistant_answer_question", {"query": "What is MCP?"})

Learn more in the [**Client Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client) and [**Transports Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/transports).

## Authentication

### Enterprise Authentication, Zero Configuration

FastMCP provides comprehensive authentication support that sets it apart from basic MCP implementations. Secure your servers and authenticate your clients with the same enterprise-grade providers used by major corporations.

**Built-in OAuth Providers:**

  * **Google**
  * **GitHub**
  * **Microsoft Azure**
  * **Auth0**
  * **WorkOS**
  * **Descope**
  * **JWT/Custom**
  * **API Keys**



Protecting a server takes just two lines:
    
    
    from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.google import GoogleProvider
    
    auth = GoogleProvider(client_id="...", client_secret="...", base_url="https://myserver.com")
    mcp = FastMCP("Protected Server", auth=auth)

Connecting to protected servers is even simpler:
    
    
    async with Client("https://protected-server.com/mcp", auth="oauth") as client:
        # Automatic browser-based OAuth flow
        result = await client.call_tool("protected_tool")

**Why FastMCP Auth Matters:**

  * **Production-Ready:** Persistent storage, token refresh, comprehensive error handling
  * **Zero-Config OAuth:** Just pass `auth="oauth"` for automatic setup
  * **Enterprise Integration:** WorkOS SSO, Azure Active Directory, Auth0 tenants
  * **Developer Experience:** Automatic browser launch, local callback server, environment variable support
  * **Advanced Architecture:** Full OIDC support, Dynamic Client Registration (DCR), and unique OAuth proxy pattern that enables DCR with any provider



_Authentication this comprehensive is unique to FastMCP 2.0._

Learn more in the **Authentication Documentation** for [servers](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth) and [clients](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/auth).

## Deployment

### From Development to Production

FastMCP supports every deployment scenario from local development to global scale:

**Development:** Run locally with a single command
    
    
    fastmcp run server.py

**Production:** Deploy to [**FastMCP Cloud**](https://fastmcp.cloud) — Remote MCP that just works

  * Instant HTTPS endpoints
  * Built-in authentication
  * Zero configuration
  * Free for personal servers



**Self-Hosted:** Use HTTP or SSE transports for your own infrastructure
    
    
    mcp.run(transport="http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

Learn more in the [**Deployment Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/deployment).

## Advanced Features

FastMCP introduces powerful ways to structure and compose your MCP applications.

### Proxy Servers

Create a FastMCP server that acts as an intermediary for another local or remote MCP server using `FastMCP.as_proxy()`. This is especially useful for bridging transports (e.g., remote SSE to local Stdio) or adding a layer of logic to a server you don't control.

Learn more in the [**Proxying Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/patterns/proxy).

### Composing MCP Servers

Build modular applications by mounting multiple `FastMCP` instances onto a parent server using `mcp.mount()` (live link) or `mcp.import_server()` (static copy).

Learn more in the [**Composition Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/patterns/composition).

### OpenAPI & FastAPI Generation

Automatically generate FastMCP servers from existing OpenAPI specifications (`FastMCP.from_openapi()`) or FastAPI applications (`FastMCP.from_fastapi()`), instantly bringing your web APIs to the MCP ecosystem.

Learn more: [**OpenAPI Integration**](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/openapi) | [**FastAPI Integration**](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/fastapi).

## Running Your Server

The main way to run a FastMCP server is by calling the `run()` method on your server instance:
    
    
    # server.py
    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    
    mcp = FastMCP("Demo 🚀")
    
    @mcp.tool
    def hello(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        mcp.run()  # Default: uses STDIO transport

FastMCP supports three transport protocols:

**STDIO (Default)** : Best for local tools and command-line scripts.
    
    
    mcp.run(transport="stdio")  # Default, so transport argument is optional

**Streamable HTTP** : Recommended for web deployments.
    
    
    mcp.run(transport="http", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000, path="/mcp")

**SSE** : For compatibility with existing SSE clients.
    
    
    mcp.run(transport="sse", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

See the [**Running Server Documentation**](https://gofastmcp.com/deployment/running-server) for more details.

## Contributing

Contributions are the core of open source! We welcome improvements and features.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.10+
  * [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Recommended for environment management)



### Setup

  1. Clone the repository:
         
         git clone https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp.git 
         cd fastmcp

  2. Create and sync the environment:
         
         uv sync

This installs all dependencies, including dev tools.

  3. Activate the virtual environment (e.g., `source .venv/bin/activate` or via your IDE).




### Unit Tests

FastMCP has a comprehensive unit test suite. All PRs must introduce or update tests as appropriate and pass the full suite.

Run tests using pytest:
    
    
    pytest

or if you want an overview of the code coverage
    
    
    uv run pytest --cov=src --cov=examples --cov-report=html

### Static Checks

FastMCP uses `prek` for code formatting, linting, and type-checking. All PRs must pass these checks (they run automatically in CI).

Install the hooks locally:
    
    
    uv run prek install

The hooks will now run automatically on `git commit`. You can also run them manually at any time:
    
    
    prek run --all-files
    # or via uv
    uv run prek run --all-files

### Pull Requests

  1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
  2. Create a feature branch from `main`.
  3. Make your changes, including tests and documentation updates.
  4. Ensure tests and prek hooks pass.
  5. Commit your changes and push to your fork.
  6. Open a pull request against the `main` branch of `jlowin/fastmcp`.

#  Windows command injection in FastMCP Cursor installer via server_name 

Moderate 

[jlowin](/jlowin) published GHSA-rj5c-58rq-j5g5 Oct 28, 2025

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 2.13.0

## Patched versions

2.13.0

## Description

### Summary

A command-injection vulnerability lets any attacker who can influence the server_name field of an MCP execute arbitrary OS commands on Windows hosts that run fastmcp install cursor

### Details

  1. generate_cursor_deeplink(server_name, …) embeds server_name verbatim in a cursor://…?name= query string.
  2. open_deeplink() is invoked with shell=True only on Windows. That calls cmd.exe /c start .
  3. Any cmd metacharacter inside server_name (&, |, >, ^, …) escapes the start command and spawns an attacker-chosen process.



### PoC

server.py
    
    
    import random
    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    
    mcp = FastMCP(name="test&calc")
    
    @mcp.tool
    def roll_dice(n_dice: int) -> list[int]:
        """Roll `n_dice` 6-sided dice and return the results."""
        return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        mcp.run()
    

then run in the terminal:  
`fastmcp install cursor server.py`

### Impact

OS Command / Shell Injection (CWE-78)  
Every Windows host that runs fastmcp install cursor is at risk. Developers on their local workstations, CI/CD agents and corporate build machines alike.

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector: This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity: This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements: This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required: This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction: This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.

##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality: This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity: This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability: This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality: This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity: This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability: This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

#  FastMCP Auth Integration Allows for Confused Deputy Account Takeover 

High 

[jlowin](/jlowin) published GHSA-c2jp-c369-7pvx Oct 28, 2025

## Package

pip fastmcp ([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip)) 

## Affected versions

< 2.13.0

## Patched versions

2.13.0

## Description

### Summary

FastMCP documentation [covers the scenario](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/azure) where it is possible to use Entra ID or other providers for authentication. In this context, because Entra ID does not support Dynamic Client Registration (DCR), the FastMCP-hosted MCP server is acting as the authorization provider, as declared in the Protected Resource Metadata (PRM) document hosted on the server.

For example, on a local MCP server, it may be hosted here:
    
    
    http://localhost:8000/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource

And the JSON representation of the PRM document:
    
    
    {
      "resource": "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
      "authorization_servers": [
        "http://localhost:8000/"
      ],
      "scopes_supported": [
        "User.Read",
        "email",
        "openid",
        "profile"
      ],
      "bearer_methods_supported": [
        "header"
      ]
    }

Notice that the `authorization_servers` field contains the MCP server itself - it acts as an **OAuth Client** to the downstream authorization server (e.g., Entra ID) and as a **Authorization Server** (AS) to the MCP client.

The FastMCP server also hosts the AS metadata:
    
    
    http://localhost:8000/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server

With the following content:
    
    
    {
      "issuer": "http://localhost:8000/",
      "authorization_endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/authorize",
      "token_endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/token",
      "registration_endpoint": "http://localhost:8000/register",
      "scopes_supported": [
        "User.Read",
        "email",
        "openid",
        "profile"
      ],
      "response_types_supported": [
        "code"
      ],
      "grant_types_supported": [
        "authorization_code",
        "refresh_token"
      ],
      "token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported": [
        "client_secret_post"
      ],
      "code_challenge_methods_supported": [
        "S256"
      ]
    }

All of this confirms that the FastMCP server is, in fact, handling the client-to-server authorization and then delegating the downstream effects (i.e., authorization with Entra ID) to its own redirect logic, with a call like this (as seen through MCP Inspector):
    
    
    http://localhost:8000/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=fdec0bb8-3423-40d0-aa2a-73de26bf6f93&code_challenge=2a9ZxAEr5NEsKPwFWuEFA1W-kFMXc-02u6qc8aLf_g4&code_challenge_method=S256&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A6274%2Foauth%2Fcallback%2Fdebug&state=9f23fd47e2b8786b502f116bdbfd6ae3d7d2801167e24fea82f608bb52312bbd&scope=User.Read+email+openid+profile&resource=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8000%2Fmcp

When using the built-in FastMCP `/authorize` endpoint, and in the example above, FastMCP server configured with Entra ID, it will then redirect the user here:
    
    
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/412e93fe-74e5-4ee6-9b67-1eeb1c79550e/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=7bac43f2-ca62-4148-93a5-fd5686cb16c0&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8000%2Fauth%2Fcallback&state=Tcv7bbg_v0Qi69RHbCzqR4tQHSHKPQuDDxjuo0wu5qU&scope=User.Read+email+openid+profile&code_challenge=bxICFAJDViuTTHIPUPdSXGLKbNbgPwiB-0ITXUJkjYM&code_challenge_method=S256&resource=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8000%2Fmcp

Note

In the scenario above, I have an app registration in Entra ID that I set up in my FastMCP server, as outlined in the PoC below.

Notice that the client ID and redirect URIs in the `login.microsoftonline.com` call are different than the initial `/authorize` call - that's because we're now switching to using the MCP server's **static app registration** instead of the DCR client details.

Completing the authorization flow here for the first time for a user would trigger the Entra ID consent flow:

[](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/53200638/492511239-2cc4b7ee-c110-4623-8f86-438821f4addf.png?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.vjZHZ-5Xa72oL3YgbMHUAzdWv5NgeutKRsbHiXfJ5UM)

This consent flow is **only showed the first time the user needs to use this application**. Once the consent is set, they will never be prompted for this unless revoked.

This is where the vulnerability comes in. After the user consented and is authorized, Entra ID will set a browser cookie capturing the authorization state. This helps prevent nagging re-authorization prompts.

With the user consented to the **static client for Entra ID** that the FastMCP server exposes, they will now not be prompted the next time they need to use the same application ID.

Now, an attacker comes in - in **their own MCP client** (i.e., they maintain one at `https://evil.example.com`) they start the authorization with the same remote MCP server and get to the point where the server produces **their own** authorization URI for this client ID:
    
    
    http://localhost:8000/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=9a5d63d0-3aa3-465c-b097-0e2e196392dd&code_challenge=2F4Lbfppwd7xuynLT1y4Cy2Dac-S6HOO2B84itAwppw&code_challenge_method=S256&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fevil.example.com%3A6274%2Foauth%2Fcallback%2Fdebug&state=221fab2ccdc1481511639c110ee7382445930e22be25396b01f32d973d7176dc&scope=User.Read+email+openid+profile&resource=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8000%2Fmcp

Important

Note that the redirect URI above points to the `https://evil.example.com` client.

At this point - they grab the URL and **coerce the victim** (user that already authenticated with Entra ID on their machine) to click on this link. This could be done through spam, spear-phishing, or any other traditional link sharing approaches. The moment the victim clicks on this link, they will be taken to the browser, where there is already a cookie set by Entra ID for the **static Entra ID client that the MCP server is using**. The DCR-d **registered client ID** that the FastMCP server is handling now got linked to the internal FastMCP authorization server, and the authorization code is returned to `https://evil.example.com`.

The user will be automatically speed-ran through the authorization flow (no prompts) and they will effectively give access to the MCP server to the attacker with their account. Attacker can now exchange the authorization code for a token and access the remote MCP server as the victim.

### Details

See above - the outline covers the attack vector.

### PoC

Standard documented sample that uses Entra ID:
    
    
    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.azure import AzureProvider
    
    # The AzureProvider handles Azure's token format and validation
    auth_provider = AzureProvider(
        client_id="f527ed01-9725-45bd-8173-8d3a017ba02f",  # Your Azure App Client ID
        client_secret="H3X8Q~coFQaI_zpYXePrzdRFZ7xmwEORJJ49tcnw",                 # Your Azure App Client Secret
        tenant_id="412e93fe-74e5-4ee6-9b67-1eeb1c79550e", # Your Azure Tenant ID (REQUIRED)
        base_url="http://localhost:8000",                   # Must match your App registration
        required_scopes=["User.Read", "email", "openid", "profile"],  # Microsoft Graph permissions
        # redirect_path="/auth/callback"                  # Default value, customize if needed
    )
    
    mcp = FastMCP(name="Azure Secured App", auth=auth_provider)
    
    # Add a protected tool to test authentication
    @mcp.tool
    async def get_user_info() -> dict:
        """Returns information about the authenticated Azure user."""
        from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_access_token
        
        token = get_access_token()
        # The AzureProvider stores user data in token claims
        return {
            "azure_id": token.claims.get("sub"),
            "email": token.claims.get("email"),
            "name": token.claims.get("name"),
            "job_title": token.claims.get("job_title"),
            "office_location": token.claims.get("office_location")
        }

#  Reflected XSS in client's callback page 

Moderate 

[jlowin](/jlowin) published GHSA-mxxr-jv3v-6pgc Oct 28, 2025

## Package

pip fastmcp ([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip)) 

## Affected versions

<2.13.0

## Patched versions

2.13.0

## Description

### Summary

While setting up an oauth client, it was noticed that the callback page hosted by the client during the flow embbeds user-controlled content without escaping or sanitizing it. This leads to a reflected Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability.

### Details

The affected code is located in _<https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/blob/main/src/fastmcp/client/oauth_callback.py>_ , which embeds all values passed to the `create_callback_html` function via the `message` parameter it into the callback page without escaping them. This can, for example, be abused by calling the callback server with an XSS payload inside the `error` GET parameter, the value of which will then be inserted into the callback page, causing the execution of attacker-controlled JavaScript code in the callback server's origin. Note that besides the `error` parameter, other parameters reaching this function are affected too.

### PoC

  1. Setup a simple fastmcp client such as this one (the callback server's port was fixated for simplicity):


    
    
    url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
    oauth = OAuth(mcp_url=url,callback_port=1337)
    
    async def main():
        async with Client(url, auth=oauth) as client:
            await client.ping()
            
            # List available operations
            tools = await client.list_tools()
    
            print(f"tools: {tools}")
           
    asyncio.run(main())
    

  2. Ensure that the MCP server located at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` supports oauth.
  3. Start the client.
  4. As soon as the callback server has been started, access `http://localhost:1337/callback?error=<img/src/onerror=alert(window.origin)>`



Note that the exploitation could also for example be initiated by a malicious authorization server by returning the exploitation URL mentioned before in the `authorization_endpoint` field. The client would then automatically open, causing the XSS to trigger immediatly.

### Impact

The impact of this XSS vulnerability is the arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser in the callback server's origin.

### Severity

Moderate 

### CVE ID

CVE-2025-62800 

### Weaknesses

Weakness CWE-79

####  [Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')](/advisories?query=cwe%3A79)

The product does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.  [Learn more on MITRE.](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

### Description

# FastMCP Bug Report: outputSchema with $ref at root violates MCP spec

## Summary

When FastMCP generates `outputSchema` for tools that return self-referential Pydantic models, it produces schemas with `$ref` at the root level without `"type": "object"`. This violates the MCP specification and causes MCP clients to reject the tools.

## Environment

  * FastMCP version: 2.13.1
  * Pydantic version: 2.12.4
  * MCP client: Claude Code 2.0.47
  * Python version: 3.13.9



## Reproduction

### 1\. Create a self-referential Pydantic model
    
    
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    
    class Issue(BaseModel):
        id: str
        title: str
        # Self-referential fields
        dependencies: list["Issue"] = []
        dependents: list["Issue"] = []

### 2\. Create a FastMCP tool that returns this model
    
    
    from fastmcp import FastMCP
    
    mcp = FastMCP("test")
    
    @mcp.tool()
    async def get_issue(issue_id: str) -> Issue:
        """Get an issue by ID."""
        return Issue(id=issue_id, title="Test")

### 3\. The generated outputSchema

Pydantic generates this schema (which is valid JSON Schema):
    
    
    {
      "$defs": {
        "Issue": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "id": {"type": "string"},
            "title": {"type": "string"},
            "dependencies": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/Issue"}
            },
            "dependents": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/Issue"}
            }
          },
          "required": ["id", "title"]
        }
      },
      "$ref": "#/$defs/Issue"
    }

**Note the root level has no`"type": "object"` field.**

## Expected Behavior

According to the [MCP specification](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2025-06-18/schema.ts#L128-L133), `outputSchema` MUST have `"type": "object"` at the root level:
    
    
    outputSchema?: {
      type: "object";
      properties?: { [key: string]: object };
      required?: string[];
    };

FastMCP should resolve the `$ref` to produce:
    
    
    {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": {"type": "string"},
        "title": {"type": "string"},
        "dependencies": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/Issue"}
        },
        "dependents": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/Issue"}
        }
      },
      "required": ["id", "title"],
      "$defs": {
        "Issue": { ... }
      }
    }

## Actual Behavior

FastMCP's `_is_object_schema()` function in `fastmcp/tools/tool.py` recognizes the schema as an object type:
    
    
    def _is_object_schema(schema: dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Check if a JSON schema represents an object type."""
        if schema.get("type") == "object":
            return True
        if "properties" in schema:
            return True
        # Self-referencing types use $ref pointing to $defs
        # The referenced type is always an object in our use case
        return "$ref" in schema and "$defs" in schema

However, it **accepts the schema as-is** without transforming it to meet MCP requirements. The schema is sent to MCP clients without the required `"type": "object"` field.

## Impact

MCP clients that properly validate against the MCP spec reject these tools with errors like:
    
    
    Failed to fetch tools: [
      {
        "code": "invalid_literal",
        "expected": "object",
        "path": ["tools", 4, "outputSchema", "type"],
        "message": "Invalid literal value, expected \"object\""
      }
    ]
    

This prevents **all tools** from the MCP server from loading, not just the problematic one.

## Root Cause

The issue is in `ParsedFunction.from_function()` in `fastmcp/tools/tool.py`. After Pydantic generates the schema, FastMCP uses it directly without checking if it meets MCP requirements:
    
    
    # Around line 170-190
    if output_type not in (inspect._empty, None, Any, ...):
        # ... generate schema from Pydantic ...
        type_adapter = get_cached_typeadapter(clean_output_type)
        base_schema = type_adapter.json_schema(mode="serialization")
    
        # ... wrapping logic for non-object types ...
    
        output_schema = compress_schema(output_schema, prune_titles=True)

The schema goes through `compress_schema()` but never gets checked or transformed to ensure `"type": "object"` at root.

## Suggested Fix

When FastMCP detects a schema with `$ref` at the root level, it should resolve the reference:
    
    
    def _resolve_root_ref(schema: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Resolve $ref at root level to meet MCP spec requirements."""
        if "$ref" in schema and "$defs" in schema and "type" not in schema:
            # Extract the reference path
            ref = schema["$ref"]  # e.g., "#/$defs/Issue"
            if ref.startswith("#/$defs/"):
                def_name = ref.split("/")[-1]
                if def_name in schema["$defs"]:
                    # Get the referenced schema
                    resolved = schema["$defs"][def_name].copy()
                    # Preserve $defs for nested references
                    resolved["$defs"] = schema["$defs"]
                    return resolved
        return schema

Apply this after schema generation but before validation:
    
    
    if output_type not in (inspect._empty, None, Any, ...):
        # ... existing schema generation ...
    
        output_schema = compress_schema(output_schema, prune_titles=True)
    
        # NEW: Resolve root-level $ref to meet MCP spec
        output_schema = _resolve_root_ref(output_schema)

## Workaround

Currently, there's no workaround without modifying FastMCP or avoiding self-referential models in return types.

## Related Code

  * `fastmcp/tools/tool.py`: `ParsedFunction.from_function()` (~line 170-230)
  * `fastmcp/tools/tool.py`: `_is_object_schema()` (~line 590)
  * `fastmcp/tools/tool.py`: `FunctionTool.from_function()` (~line 450)



## Test Case

A test should verify that self-referential models produce MCP-compliant schemas:
    
    
    def test_self_referential_model_outputschema():
        from pydantic import BaseModel
        from fastmcp.tools.tool import ParsedFunction
    
        class Node(BaseModel):
            id: str
            children: list["Node"] = []
    
        async def get_node() -> Node:
            return Node(id="1")
    
        parsed = ParsedFunction.from_function(get_node)
    
        # Should have "type": "object" at root
        assert parsed.output_schema is not None
        assert parsed.output_schema.get("type") == "object"
        assert "properties" in parsed.output_schema

* * *

## Additional Context

This issue was discovered when using the [beads MCP server](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) with Claude Code. The `Issue` model has self-referential `dependencies` and `dependents` fields, which causes all MCP tools to fail to load.

The Pydantic-generated schema is valid JSON Schema, but FastMCP needs to transform it to meet the more restrictive MCP specification requirements.

### Description

Some MCP clients (eg, the popular mcp-remote) are requested standard OIDC scopes from the MCP server (such as openid, email, profile). The current implementation of the azure auth provider prefixes them with api://xxx/ making the authorization call fail.

Below is my current fix for that.

### Example Code
    
    
    class CustomAzureProvider(AzureProvider):
        """Custom Azure provider that filters out standard OIDC scopes from client requests."""
    
        _STANDARD_OIDC_SCOPES = {"openid", "email", "profile", "offline_access"}
    
        async def authorize(self, client: "OAuthClientInformationFull", params: "AuthorizationParams") -> str:
            """Override authorize to filter out standard OIDC scopes from client-requested scopes."""
            # Filter out standard OIDC scopes from client-requested scopes
            # Also check for prefixed versions (e.g., api://xxx/openid)
            custom_scopes = []
            oidc_scopes = []
    
            if params.scopes:
                for scope in params.scopes:
                    # Check if it's a standard OIDC scope (unprefixed)
                    if scope in self._STANDARD_OIDC_SCOPES:
                        oidc_scopes.append(scope)
                    # Check if it's a prefixed OIDC scope (e.g., api://xxx/openid)
                    elif scope.startswith(f"{self.identifier_uri}/"):
                        scope_name = scope.split("/")[-1]
                        if scope_name in self._STANDARD_OIDC_SCOPES:
                            oidc_scopes.append(scope_name)  # Store unprefixed version
                        else:
                            custom_scopes.append(scope)  # It's a custom prefixed scope
                    else:
                        # Check if it's a prefixed scope that might be OIDC
                        # (in case identifier_uri is different)
                        scope_parts = scope.split("/")
                        if len(scope_parts) > 1 and scope_parts[-1] in self._STANDARD_OIDC_SCOPES:
                            oidc_scopes.append(scope_parts[-1])  # Store unprefixed version
                        else:
                            custom_scopes.append(scope)
    
            # Update params with filtered custom scopes only
            # If no custom scopes, use None so it falls back to required_scopes
            updated_scopes = custom_scopes if custom_scopes else None
            params = params.model_copy(update={"scopes": updated_scopes})
    
            # Add OIDC scopes to additional_authorize_scopes if not already present
            if oidc_scopes:
                existing_additional = set(self.additional_authorize_scopes or [])
                new_additional = existing_additional | set(oidc_scopes)
                self.additional_authorize_scopes = list(new_additional)
                logger.debug(
                    f"Filtered out standard OIDC scopes {oidc_scopes} from client request, "
                    f"added to additional_authorize_scopes. Custom scopes: {custom_scopes}"
                )
    
            # Call parent authorize method with filtered params
            return await super().authorize(client, params)

### Description

When describing a parameter using pydantic FastMCP parses it in a full JsonSchema. Seems like following my research that OpenAI Completion API does not accept all definitions in particular optional fields that are parsed as follows
    
    
    {
        "figsize": {
            "anyOf": [
                {
                    "maxItems": 2,
                    "minItems": 2,
                    "prefixItems": [{"type": "number"}, {"type": "number"}],
                    "type": "array",
                },
                {"type": "null"},
            ],
            "default": [10, 6],
            "title": "Figsize",
        }
    }

This schema causes an API call to azure to get the following error

`Invalid schema for function 'generate_chart_ui': In context=('properties', 'figsize', 'anyOf', '0'), array schema missing items."`

Has anyone found a workaround ? A way to change the JsonSchema to be compatible with OpenAI ?  
Thanks

### Example Code
    
    
    class FigureConfig(BaseModel):
        """Configuration for the figure"""
    
        figsize: Optional[tuple[float, float]] = Field(default=(10, 6))

### Description

I did some digging the official spec on this but can't get to the bottom of it.

Testing our FastMCP MCP server with Windsurf. Windsurf fails to connect because it requests `mcp.read` and `mcp.write` scopes. I don't specify these anywhere in our implementation.

Looking at the SDK, the only place I can see to add them would be in the GoogleProvider `required_scopes` field. AFAIK though, that would then request those scopes from Google. Haven't tested but I assume it'll reject them since they're not Google scopes. My understanding of these scopes are they are scopes the server itself accepts; I can't find a way of specifying those scopes.

OR: should Windsurf actually _not_ be requesting these scopes? Most other clients don't appear to do this.

### Description

I have this very strange issue. When using postman to test against my MCP server, I get continues an 401 error (SSE error: Non-200 status code (401) if I use in postman the option for Bearer Token Authentication.

If I just add a header "Authorization" with value "bearer [my-token]" is all works fine.

Any idea why FastMCP is not reading the bearer token from postman when send via the Authorization option?

opened [on Aug 28, 2025](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/issues/1657#issue-3363239074)

Issue body actions

### Description

I have the following setup:

Two MCP servers (one in Python with fastmcp, another in TypeScript MCP).

One FastAPI application that uses a fastmcp client to connect to these servers.

The MCP client is initialized at FastAPI startup and is later used in a router endpoint to make tool calls and list tools.

### Problem

Occasionally, I encounter the following error in the MCP server logs:

`Unexpected http.response.start ASGI Error with fastmcp`

### When this happens:

The FastAPI app shows nothing in the logs after the request.

No response is returned to the client, and the process appears to hang.

It does not always reproduce, but happens intermittently.

Expected Behavior

FastAPI app should continue processing tool calls without hanging.

MCP client/server communication should not break due to ` http.response.start` errors.

Issue body actions

### Enhancement

When using the OAuthProxy providers (e.g. GoogleProvider) it currently isn't supported that the upstream provider returns different scopes than requested. For instance this occurs when requesting 'email' scope, which ensures that `tokeninfo` includes the email of the user and information if the email of the user has been verified by the upstream provider.

Ways to replicate: Use `required_scopes=["openid", "email"]` when instantiate GoogleProvider. Observe that token verification fails with "Google token missing required scopes. Has 2, requested 2." (it returns `["openid", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"]`)

Suggestion:

  * Separate fields for the scopes which should be requested by the upstream provider and the scopes which are required should be maintained. (For instance: The user might not grant profile scope for instance in a request.)

Issue body actions

### Description

Some MCP clients (eg, the popular mcp-remote) are requested standard OIDC scopes from the MCP server (such as openid, email, profile). The current implementation of the azure auth provider prefixes them with api://xxx/ making the authorization call fail.

Below is my current fix for that.

### Example Code
    
    
    class CustomAzureProvider(AzureProvider):
        """Custom Azure provider that filters out standard OIDC scopes from client requests."""
    
        _STANDARD_OIDC_SCOPES = {"openid", "email", "profile", "offline_access"}
    
        async def authorize(self, client: "OAuthClientInformationFull", params: "AuthorizationParams") -> str:
            """Override authorize to filter out standard OIDC scopes from client-requested scopes."""
            # Filter out standard OIDC scopes from client-requested scopes
            # Also check for prefixed versions (e.g., api://xxx/openid)
            custom_scopes = []
            oidc_scopes = []
    
            if params.scopes:
                for scope in params.scopes:
                    # Check if it's a standard OIDC scope (unprefixed)
                    if scope in self._STANDARD_OIDC_SCOPES:
                        oidc_scopes.append(scope)
                    # Check if it's a prefixed OIDC scope (e.g., api://xxx/openid)
                    elif scope.startswith(f"{self.identifier_uri}/"):
                        scope_name = scope.split("/")[-1]
                        if scope_name in self._STANDARD_OIDC_SCOPES:
                            oidc_scopes.append(scope_name)  # Store unprefixed version
                        else:
                            custom_scopes.append(scope)  # It's a custom prefixed scope
                    else:
                        # Check if it's a prefixed scope that might be OIDC

### Description

Azure Provider fails to complete the idP token exchange once Azure fails.

IdP token exchange failed: invalid_client: AADSTS700025: Client is public so neither oauth_proxy.py:1665'client_assertion' nor 'client_secret' should be presented.

Also the scopes not matches with provided on  
<https://login.microsoftonline.com/xxxxxxxxxxxxxx/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration>

In my case:  
"scopes_supported": [  
"openid",  
"profile",  
"email",  
"offline_access"  
],

### Example Code
    
    
    azure_oauth_provider = AzureProvider(
        client_id=AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret=AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET,
        tenant_id=AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID,
        base_url="http://localhost:8080",
        redirect_path="/auth/callback/",
        required_scopes=[f"{AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID}/.default"],
    )
    
    INFO |httpx                    |HTTP Request: POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/xxxxxxxxxxx/oauth2/v2.0/token "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized"

### Description

I did some digging the official spec on this but can't get to the bottom of it.

Testing our FastMCP MCP server with Windsurf. Windsurf fails to connect because it requests `mcp.read` and `mcp.write` scopes. I don't specify these anywhere in our implementation.

Looking at the SDK, the only place I can see to add them would be in the GoogleProvider `required_scopes` field. AFAIK though, that would then request those scopes from Google. Haven't tested but I assume it'll reject them since they're not Google scopes. My understanding of these scopes are they are scopes the server itself accepts; I can't find a way of specifying those scopes.

OR: should Windsurf actually _not_ be requesting these scopes? Most other clients don't appear to do this.

### Enhancement

The following changes are being requested for Scalekit Provider:

  1. Support for required_scopes as an optional parameter
  2. Change `mcp_url` to `base_url` to align with the meaning of uri being passed in.
  3. Remove `aud` check in the provider layer. if needed the implementing server can make use of the aud claim from token
  4. Remove `client_id` from provider as it doesn't hold any value inside the provider

### Description

FastMCP's `OAuthProxy` returns HTTP 400 for token expiration (including `invalid_grant` for expired/missing tokens), but the MCP specification requires HTTP 401 for invalid or expired tokens. This causes some MCP clients (eg. Cursor in my case) to enter infinite retry loops instead of properly clearing tokens and re-authenticating.

## The Current Problem

### What Happens Now

  1. **Token Refresh Fails** (upstream token expired/not found)
         
         ERROR | exchange_refresh_token- Upstream token set not found: yMLAd9bf
         

The error is raised at:
         
         # In src/fastmcp/server/auth/oauth_proxy.py:82
          upstream_token_set = await self._upstream_token_store.get(
              key=jti_mapping.upstream_token_id
          )
          if not upstream_token_set:
              logger.error(
                  "Upstream token set not found: %s", jti_mapping.upstream_token_id[:8]
              )
              raise TokenError("invalid_grant", "Upstream token not found")

  2. **Server Response** : HTTP 400 Bad Request
         
         # In mcp/server/auth/handlers/token.py:82
         if isinstance(obj, TokenErrorResponse):
             status_code = 400  # <-- ALL token errors return 400

  3. **Client Receives HTTP 400** :  
Some MCP clients (like older versions of Claude Desktop or Cursor) may have different retry logic that:



  * Treats HTTP 400 as "temporary/malformed request" → retry
  * Treats HTTP 401 as "authentication failed" → clear tokens and re-auth



This is because:

  * **HTTP 400 semantics** : "Bad Request" - typically means malformed syntax, client should fix the request
  * **HTTP 401 semantics** : "Unauthorized" - typically means authentication failed, client should re-authenticate



## MCP Specification Requirement

From [MCP Authorization Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization):

> **"Invalid or expired tokens MUST receive a HTTP 401 response."**

Status code requirements:

Status Code | Purpose  
---|---  
**401 Unauthorized** | "Authorization required or token invalid"  
**400 Bad Request** | "Malformed authorization request"  
**403 Forbidden** | "Invalid scopes or insufficient permissions"
