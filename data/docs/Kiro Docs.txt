## What is steering?

Steering gives Kiro persistent knowledge about your workspace through markdown files. Instead of explaining your conventions in every chat, steering files ensure Kiro consistently follows your established patterns, libraries, and standards.

## Key benefits

**Consistent Code Generation** \- Every component, API endpoint, or test follows your team's established patterns and conventions.

**Reduced Repetition** \- No need to explain workspace standards in each conversation. Kiro remembers your preferences.

**Team Alignment** \- All developers work with the same standards, whether they're new to the workspace or seasoned contributors.

**Scalable Project Knowledge** \- Documentation that grows with your codebase, capturing decisions and patterns as your project evolves.

## Steering file scope

Steering files can be created with a workspace scope or a global scope.

### Workspace steering

Workspace steering files reside in your workspace root folder under `.kiro/steering/`, and apply only to that specific workspace. Workspace steering files can be used to inform Kiro of patterns, libraries, and standards that apply to an individual workspace.

### Global steering

Global steering files reside in your home directory under `~/.kiro/steering/`, and apply to all workspaces. Global steering files can be used to inform Kiro of conventions that apply to _all_ your workspaces.

In case of conflicting instructions between global and workspace steering, Kiro will prioritize the workspace steering instructions. This allows you to specify global directives that generally apply to all your workspaces, while preserving the ability to override those directives for specific workspaces.

### Team steering

The global steering feature can be used to define centralized steering files that apply to entire teams. Team steering files can be pushed to user's PCs via MDM solutions or Group Policies, or downloaded by users to their PCs from a central repository, and placed into the `~/.kiro/steering` folder.

## Foundational steering files

Kiro provides foundational steering files to establish core project context. You can generate these files as follows:

  1. Navigate to the **Steering** section in the Kiro panel
  2. Click the **Generate Steering Docs** button, or click the **+** button and select the **Foundation steering files** option
  3. Kiro will create three foundational files:



**Product Overview** (`product.md`) - Defines your product's purpose, target users, key features, and business objectives. This helps Kiro understand the "why" behind technical decisions and suggest solutions aligned with your product goals.

**Technology Stack** (`tech.md`) - Documents your chosen frameworks, libraries, development tools, and technical constraints. When Kiro suggests implementations, it will prefer your established stack over alternatives.

**Project Structure** (`structure.md`) - Outlines file organization, naming conventions, import patterns, and architectural decisions. This ensures generated code fits seamlessly into your existing codebase.

These foundation files are included in every interaction by default, forming the baseline of Kiro's project understanding.

## Creating custom steering files

  1. Navigate to the **Steering** section in the Kiro panel
  2. Click the **+** button
  3. Select the scope of the steering file: workspace or global
  4. Choose a descriptive filename (e.g., `api-standards.md`)
  5. Write your guidance using standard markdown syntax
  6. Use natural language to describe your requirements
  7. Optionally, for workspace steering files, you can use the **Refine** button to have Kiro refine your requirements



Once created, steering files become immediately available across all Kiro interactions.

## Agents.md

Kiro supports providing steering directives via the [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) standard. AGENTS.md files are in markdown format, similar to Kiro steering files; however, AGENTS.md files do not support inclusion modes and are always included.

You can add AGENTS.md files to the global steering file location (`~/.kiro/steering/`), or to the root folder of your workspace, and they will get picked up by Kiro automatically.

## Inclusion modes

Steering files can be configured to load at different times based on your needs. This flexibility helps optimize performance and ensures relevant context is available when needed.

Configure inclusion modes by adding front matter to the top of your steering files. The front matter uses YAML syntax and must be placed at the very beginning of the file, enclosed by triple dashes (`---`).

### Always included (default)

yaml
    
    
    ---
    inclusion: always
    ---
    

These files are loaded into every Kiro interaction automatically. Use this mode for core standards that should influence all code generation and suggestions. Examples include your technology stack, coding conventions, and fundamental architectural principles.

**Best for** : Workspace-wide standards, technology preferences, security policies, and coding conventions that apply universally.

### Conditional inclusion

yaml
    
    
    ---
    inclusion: fileMatch
    fileMatchPattern: "components/**/*.tsx"
    ---
    

Files are automatically included only when working with files that match the specified pattern. This keeps context relevant and reduces noise by loading specialized guidance only when needed.

**Common patterns** :

  * `"*.tsx"` \- React components and JSX files
  * `"app/api/**/*"` \- API routes and backend logic
  * `"**/*.test.*"` \- Test files and testing utilities
  * `"src/components/**/*"` \- Component-specific guidelines
  * `"*.md"` \- Documentation files



**Best for** : Domain-specific standards like component patterns, API design rules, testing approaches, or deployment procedures that only apply to certain file types.

### Manual inclusion

yaml
    
    
    ---
    inclusion: manual
    ---
    

Files are available on-demand by referencing them with `#steering-file-name` in your chat messages. This gives you precise control over when specialized context is needed without cluttering every interaction.

**Usage** : Type `#troubleshooting-guide` or `#performance-optimization` in chat to include that steering file for the current conversation.

**Best for** : Specialized workflows, troubleshooting guides, migration procedures, or context-heavy documentation that's only needed occasionally.

## File references

Link to live workspace files to keep steering current:

markdown
    
    
    #[[file:<relative_file_name>]]
    

Examples:

  * API specs: `#[[file:api/openapi.yaml]]`
  * Component patterns: `#[[file:components/ui/button.tsx]]`
  * Config templates: `#[[file:.env.example]]`



## Best practices

**Keep Files Focused** One domain per file - API design, testing, or deployment procedures.

**Use Clear Names**

  * `api-rest-conventions.md` \- REST API standards
  * `testing-unit-patterns.md` \- Unit testing approaches
  * `components-form-validation.md` \- Form component standards



**Include Context** Explain why decisions were made, not just what the standards are.

**Provide Examples** Use code snippets and before/after comparisons to demonstrate standards.

**Security First** Never include API keys, passwords, or sensitive data. Steering files are part of your codebase.

**Maintain Regularly**

  * Review during sprint planning and architecture changes
  * Test file references after restructuring
  * Treat steering changes like code changes - require reviews



## Common steering file strategies

**API Standards** (`api-standards.md`) - Define REST conventions, error response formats, authentication flows, and versioning strategies. Include endpoint naming patterns, HTTP status code usage, and request/response examples.

**Testing Approach** (`testing-standards.md`) - Establish unit test patterns, integration test strategies, mocking approaches, and coverage expectations. Document preferred testing libraries, assertion styles, and test file organization.

**Code Style** (`code-conventions.md`) - Specify naming patterns, file organization, import ordering, and architectural decisions. Include examples of preferred code structures, component patterns, and anti-patterns to avoid.

**Security Guidelines** (`security-policies.md`) - Document authentication requirements, data validation rules, input sanitization standards, and vulnerability prevention measures. Include secure coding practices specific to your application.

**Deployment Process** (`deployment-workflow.md`) - Outline build procedures, environment configurations, deployment steps, and rollback strategies. Include CI/CD pipeline details and environment-specific requirements.

## What are specs?

Specs or specifications are structured artifacts that formalize the development process for complex features in your application. They provide a systematic approach to transform high-level ideas into detailed implementation plans with clear tracking and accountability.

With Kiro's specs, you can:

  * **Break down requirements** into user stories with acceptance criteria
  * **Build design docs** with sequence diagrams and architecture plans
  * **Track implementation progress** across discrete tasks
  * **Collaborate effectively** between product and engineering teams



## Quickstart

Ready to create your first specification? Here's how to get started:

  1. From the Kiro pane, click the `+` button under **Specs**. Alternatively, choose **Spec** from the chat pane.
  2. Describe your project idea.
  3. Follow the three phase workflow through Requirements → Design → Implementation.

Specs bridge the gap between conceptual product requirements and technical implementation details, ensuring alignment and reducing development iterations. Kiro generates three key files that form the foundation of each specification:

  * **requirements.md** \- Captures user stories and acceptance criteria in structured EARS notation
  * **design.md** \- Documents technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations
  * **tasks.md** \- Provides a detailed implementation plan with discrete, trackable tasks

## Workflow

The workflow follows a logical progression with decision points between phases, ensuring each step is properly completed before moving to the next.

  * **Requirements Phase** (leftmost section): Define user stories and acceptance criteria in structured EARS notation
  * **Design Phase** (second section): Document the technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations
  * **Implementation Planning** (third section): Break down the work into discrete, trackable tasks with clear descriptions and outcomes
  * **Execution Phase** (rightmost section): Track progress as tasks are completed, with the ability to update and refine the spec as needed



Loading diagram...

## Requirements

The `requirements.md` file is written in the form of user stories with acceptance criteria in EARS notation. The way you wish your PM would give you requirements!

EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) notation provides a structured format for writing clear, testable requirements. In a spec's requirements.md file, each requirement follows this pattern:
    
    
    WHEN [condition/event]
    THE SYSTEM SHALL [expected behavior]
    

For example:
    
    
    WHEN a user submits a form with invalid data
    THE SYSTEM SHALL display validation errors next to the relevant fields
    

This structured approach offers several benefits:

  * **Clarity** : Requirements are unambiguous and easy to understand
  * **Testability** : Each requirement can be directly translated into test cases
  * **Traceability** : Individual requirements can be tracked through implementation
  * **Completeness** : The format encourages thinking through all conditions and behaviors



Kiro helps you transform vague feature requests into these well-structured requirements, making the development process more efficient and reducing misunderstandings between product and engineering teams.

## Design

Loading image...

The `design.md` file is where you document technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations. It's a great place to capture the big picture of how the system will work, including the components and their interactions.

Kiro's specs offer a structured approach to design documentation, making it easier to understand and collaborate on complex systems. The design.md file is a great place to capture the big picture of how the system will work, including the components and their interactions.

## Implementation plan

The `tasks.md` file is where you provide a detailed implementation plan with discrete, trackable tasks and sub-tasks. Each task is clearly defined, with a clear description, expected outcome, and any necessary resources or dependencies. Kiro's specs offer a structured approach to implementation plans, making it easier to understand and collaborate on complex systems.

Kiro provides a task execution interface for `tasks.md` files that displays real-time status updates. Tasks are updated as in-progress or completed, allowing you to efficiently track implementation progress and maintain an up-to-date view of your development status.

## How do I import existing requirements?

If your requirements or designs already exist in another system (such as JIRA, Confluence, or Word documents), you have two options:

  1. **Using MCP integration** : If your requirements tool has an [MCP server](/docs/mcp), you can connect directly to import requirements into your spec session. Kiro supports both local and remote MCP servers.

  2. **Manual import** : Simply copy your existing requirements (e.g. `foo-prfaq.md`) into a new file in your repo and open a spec chat session and say `#foo-prfaq.md Generate a spec from it`. Kiro will read your requirements, and generate requirement and design specs.




## How do I iterate on my specs?

Kiro's specifications are designed for continuous refinement, allowing you to update and enhance them as your project evolves. This iterative approach ensures that specifications remain synchronized with changing requirements and technical designs, providing a reliable foundation for development.

  1. **Update Requirements** : Either modify the `requirements.md` file directly or initiate a spec session and instruct Kiro to add new requirements or design elements.

  2. **Update Design** : Navigate to the `design.md` file for your spec and select **Refine**. This action will update both the design documentation and the associated task list to reflect your modified requirements.

  3. **Update tasks** : Navigate to the `tasks.md` file and choose **Update tasks**. This will create new tasks that map to the new requirements.




## How do I share specs with my team?

Specs are designed to be version-controlled, making them easily shareable across your team. Store specs directly in your project repository alongside the code they describe. This keeps all project artifacts together and maintains the connection between requirements and implementation.

## Can I share specs across multiple teams?

Yes, you can share specs across multiple teams by leveraging Git submodules or package references. Here are some best practices for managing shared specs across teams:

  1. **Create a central specs repository** \- Establish a dedicated repository for shared specifications that multiple projects can reference.

  2. **Use Git submodules or package references** \- Link your central specs to individual projects using Git submodules, package references, or symbolic links depending on your development environment.

  3. **Implement cross-repository workflows** \- Develop processes for proposing, reviewing, and updating shared specs that affect multiple projects.




If you have specific needs for cross-project spec management, please share your requirements on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/kirodotdev) so we can prioritize features that support your workflow.

## Can I start a spec session from a vibe session?

Yes. You can have a vibe conversation and then say `Generate spec`. Kiro will then ask you if you want to start a spec session. If you say yes, it will proceed with generating requirements based on the context of your vibe session.

## Can I execute all the tasks in my spec in a single shot?

Yes, you can execute all the tasks in your `tasks.md` file by asking the Kiro agent to `Execute all tasks in the spec`. Kiro will start executing all your tasks. Note: we do not recommend doing this as we recommend a task-wise execution to get better results.

## What if some tasks are already implemented?

When working on an existing codebase, you might find that some tasks in your spec are already complete because a coworker or you ended up doing it in another session. Here are two ways to handle this:

**Option 1: Click on Update tasks in your tasks.md**

  * Open your `tasks.md` file
  * Click **Update tasks**
  * Kiro will automatically mark completed tasks.



**Option 2: Let Kiro scan for you in a spec chat session**

  * In a spec session, ask Kiro: "Check which tasks are already complete"
  * Kiro will analyze your codebase and identify implemented functionality
  * Kiro will automatically mark completed tasks



This keeps your task spec accurate.

## How do I reference a spec in chat?

You can reference any spec from your specs list in chat conversations using the `#spec` context provider. Type `#spec` and press Enter to see a list of available specs, then select the one you want to include. Kiro automatically includes all spec files (requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md) in the conversation context to ensure responses align with your documented specifications.

## When should I use #spec in chat?

Using `#spec` is particularly helpful when you need context-aware assistance:

  * **Implementing tasks** \- Generate code that aligns with your design decisions and meets acceptance criteria
  * **Refining specs** \- Request changes to requirements, design, or tasks based on new insights
  * **Validating work** \- Check if your implementation matches the spec's requirements
  * **Asking questions** \- Get answers about your feature's architecture or design



**Examples:**
    
    
    #spec:user-authentication implement task 2.3
    #spec:user-authentication update the design file to include password reset flow
    #spec:user-authentication does my current implementation meet the acceptance criteria for task 7.1?
    #spec:user-authentication why did we choose JWT over session-based authentication?
    

## How many specs can I have in a single repo?

You can have as many specs as you want in a single repo. We recommend creating multiple specs for different features for your project rather than attempting to just have a single one for your entire codebase.

For example, in an e-commerce application, you might organize your specs like this:
    
    
    .kiro/specs/
    ├── user-authentication/       # Login, signup, password reset
    ├── product-catalog/           # Product listing, search, filtering
    ├── shopping-cart/             # Add to cart, quantity updates, checkout
    ├── payment-processing/        # Payment gateway integration, order confirmation
    └── admin-dashboard/           # Product management, user analytics
    

This approach allows you to:

  * Work on features independently without conflicts
  * Maintain focused, manageable spec documents
  * Iterate on specific functionality without affecting other areas

Kiro is an AWS application that works as a standalone agentic IDE. Kiro's security framework is built around AWS's security infrastructure and follows practices to protect your development environment and data. Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that is built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.

Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. The [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) describes this as security of the cloud and security in the cloud:

  * Security of the cloud – AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely. Third-party auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the [AWS Compliance Programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/). To learn about the compliance programs that apply to Kiro, see [AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/).

  * Security in the cloud – Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your company’s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations




This documentation helps you understand how to apply the shared responsibility model when using Kiro. It shows you how to configure Kiro to meet your security and compliance objectives. You also learn how to use other AWS services that help you to monitor and secure your Kiro resources.

## URL fetching

In the Kiro chat module, you can paste a specific URL for your device to fetch and use it as context to help Kiro answer your query or solve your task. You are responsible for the URL content that you fetch and ensuring that your use complies with any applicable third-party terms and laws.

## Autopilot versus supervised mode

In Kiro, Autopilot is enabled by default. You can toggle between Autopilot and Supervised mode at any time. Autopilot mode enables the agent to execute code changes, such as creating, modifying, searching, and deleting files in your codebase and run commands that impact the filesystem.

### Autopilot mode

In Autopilot mode, Kiro works autonomously:

  * Kiro executes multiple steps without requiring approval for each one
  * Kiro makes decisions based on its understanding of your requirements
  * You can toggle autopilot on/off in the chat interface
  * You can interrupt autopilot at any time to regain manual control



### Supervised mode

In supervised mode, Kiro works interactively with the user, requiring their approval and guidance at each step:

  * Kiro suggests actions such as file creation, modification and deletion, but waits for user confirmation before proceeding
  * Kiro asks clarifying questions when needed
  * You can review and approve each generated document or code change, thus maintaining full control over the development process



When operating in either of these modes, you can view individual or all file changes made by the agent by selecting **View all changes** in the **Chat** module. Additionally, you can also select **Revert all changes** or revert to a [checkpoint](/docs/chat/checkpoints) to restore your files to their previous state in the filesystem locally.

## Trusted commands

By default, Kiro requires approval before running any command. You can create your own trusted commands list by searching for **Kiro Agent: Trusted Commands** in your settings.

Kiro uses simple string prefix matching to determine if a command should be automatically trusted:

  * **Exact matching** : Commands must match exactly (e.g., `npm install`)
  * **Wildcard matching** : Use `*` to trust command variations (e.g., `npm *` trusts all npm commands)
  * **Universal trust** : Use `*` alone to trust all commands (use with extreme caution)



The system treats entire commands as single strings and only checks if they start with trusted patterns. It does not analyze command structure, chains, or special characters, putting full responsibility on you to carefully configure trusted patterns.

## Best practices

Kiro provides a number of security features to consider as you develop and implement your own security policies. The following best practices are general guidelines and don’t represent a complete security solution. Because these best practices might not be appropriate or sufficient for your environment, treat them as helpful considerations rather than prescriptions.

### Protecting your resources

When using GitHub or Google authentication with Kiro, be aware that the Kiro agent operates within your local environment and may access:

  * Local files and repositories
  * Environment variables
  * AWS credentials stored in your environment
  * Other configuration files with sensitive information



### Recommendations

  1. **Workspace Isolation**
     * Keep sensitive projects in separate workspaces
     * Use .gitignore to prevent access to sensitive files
     * Consider using workspace trust features in your IDE
  2. **Use a Clean Environment**
     * Consider creating a dedicated user account or container environment for Kiro
     * Limit access to only the repositories and resources needed for your current project
  3. **Manage AWS Credentials Carefully**
     * Use temporary credentials with appropriate permissions
     * Consider using AWS named profiles to isolate Kiro's access
     * For sensitive work, remove AWS credentials from your environment when not needed
  4. **Repository Access Control**
     * When using GitHub authentication, review which repositories Kiro can access
     * Use repository-specific access tokens when possible
     * Regularly audit access permissions



## Remote extensions security

**Warning**

**Security Note** : Using remote extensions opens a connection between your local machine and the remote machine. Only connect to secure remote machines that you trust and that are owned by a party whom you trust. A compromised remote could use the connection to execute code on your local machine.

Kiro supports Open VSX extensions, including remote SSH extensions, to provide a familiar development experience. For comprehensive information about extension compatibility and support in Kiro, see our [extension compatibility guide](/docs/guides/migrating-from-vscode/#extension-compatibility).

By following these practices, you can enjoy Kiro's capabilities while maintaining appropriate security boundaries for your development environment.

[Site Terms](https://aws.amazon.com/terms/)[License](/license/)[Responsible AI Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/responsible-ai/policy/)[Legal](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/)[Privacy Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/)Cookie Preferences

The AWS [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) applies to data protection in Kiro. As described in this model, AWS is responsible for protecting the global infrastructure that runs all of the AWS Cloud. You are responsible for maintaining control over your content that is hosted on this infrastructure. You are also responsible for the security configuration and management tasks for the AWS services that you use. For more information about data privacy, see the [Data Privacy FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/).

## Data storage

Kiro stores your questions, its responses, and additional context, such as code, to generate new responses to your requests. For information about how data is encrypted, see Data encryption. For information about how AWS may use some questions that you ask Kiro and its responses to improve our services, see Kiro service improvement.

### AWS regions where content is stored and processed

If you are a Kiro Free Tier user or a Kiro individual subscriber, your content, such as prompts and responses, will be stored in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.

If you are a [Kiro enterprise user](../../enterprise/concepts/#kiro-enterprise-user), your content will be stored in the AWS Region where your Kiro profile was created.

With cross-region inferencing, your content may be processed in a different Region within the geography where your content is stored. For more information, see Cross-region processing.

## Cross-region processing

The following sections describe how cross-region inference and cross-region calls are used to provide the Kiro service.

### Cross-region inference

Kiro is powered by Amazon Bedrock, and uses cross-region inference to distribute traffic across different AWS Regions to enhance large language model (LLM) inference performance and reliability. With cross-region inference, you get increased throughput and resilience during high demand periods, as well as improved performance.

Cross region inference doesn’t affect where your data is stored. For information on where data is stored when you use Kiro, see AWS Regions where content is stored and processed.

### Supported regions for Kiro cross-region inference

For models or capabilities under the experimental tag, see “Global cross-region inference for experimental features”.

Supported Kiro geography| Inference regions  
---|---  
United States| 

  * US East (N. Virginia) (`us-east-1`)
  * US West (Oregon) (`us-west-2`)
  * US East (Ohio) (`us-east-2`)

  
Europe| 

  * Europe (Frankfurt) (`eu-central-1`)
  * Europe (Ireland) (`eu-west-1`)
  * Europe (Paris) (`eu-west-3`)
  * Europe (Stockholm) (`eu-north-1`)
  * Europe (Milan) (`eu-south-1`)
  * Europe (Spain) (`eu-south-2`)

  
  
### Global cross-region inference for experimental features

Kiro may introduce new models and capabilities under an experimental tag, which process data differently than in the table above. When a model is launched as experimental, Kiro may use global cross-region inference to improve performance, increase throughput, and take advantage of available capacity across supported commercial AWS Regions worldwide. Global cross-region inference applies only to models and features explicitly designated as experimental.

For models and capabilities marked as experimental:

  * Inference requests may be processed in multiple AWS Regions globally, including Regions outside the one associated with your Kiro profile.
  * The Region where your data is stored is not affected by global cross-region inference.
  * This global routing is used to optimize resource availability and allow consistent performance for experimental model launches.



## Data encryption

This topic provides information specific to Kiro about encryption in transit and encryption at rest.

### Encryption in transit

All communication between customers and Kiro and between Kiro and its downstream dependencies is protected using TLS 1.2 or higher connections.

### Encryption at rest

Kiro encrypts your data using AWS owned encryption keys from AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). You don’t have to take any action to protect the AWS managed keys that encrypt your data. For more information, see [AWS owned keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-owned-cmk) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

When you subscribe with Kiro enterprise, administrators have the option to create customer managed keys to encrypt your data. Customer managed keys are KMS keys in your AWS account that you create, own, and manage to directly control access to your data by controlling access to the KMS key. Only symmetric keys are supported. For information on creating your own KMS key, see [Creating keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.

To set up a customer managed key to encrypt data as a Kiro enterprise administrator, you need permissions to use AWS KMS. The required KMS permissions are included in the [example IAM policy](). After creating a customer managed KMS key, you must provide the key in the Kiro console to use it to encrypt data.

## Service improvement

To help Kiro provide the most relevant information, we may use certain content from Kiro, such as questions that you ask Kiro, other inputs you provide, and the responses and code that Kiro generates, for service improvement. This page explains what content we use and how to opt out.

### Kiro content used for service improvement

We may use certain content from Kiro Free Tier and Kiro individual subscribers for service improvement. Users that have a paid Kiro subscription and access it through a social login provider (like GitHub or Google) or through AWS Builder ID are considered _individual subscribers_. Content that Kiro may use for service improvement includes, for example, your questions to Kiro, other inputs you provide, and the responses and code that Kiro generates. Kiro may use this content, for example, to provide better responses to common questions, fix Kiro operational issues, for de-bugging, or for model training.

We do not use content from [Kiro enterprise users](../../enterprise/concepts/#kiro-enterprise-user) for service improvement.

**Info**

If you have an Amazon Q Developer Pro subscription and access Kiro through your AWS account with the Amazon Q Developer Pro subscription, then Kiro will not use your content for service improvement.

## Opt out of data sharing

By default, Kiro collects usage data, errors, crash reports, and other metrics as well as content for service improvement from Kiro Free Tier users and Kiro individual subscribers. This section explains how to opt out of sharing your data in Kiro for Kiro Free Tier and Kiro individual subscribers. For information on how Kiro uses this data, see Kiro service improvement.

[Kiro enterprise users](../../enterprise/concepts/#kiro-enterprise-user) are automatically opted out of telemetry and content collection by AWS. Telemetry collection settings for [user activity reports](../../enterprise/monitor-and-track/user-activity/) are controlled by the administrator in the Kiro console and cannot be configured by Kiro enterprise users. For more information, see [Kiro enterprise settings](../../enterprise/settings).

### Opting out of sharing data in the IDE

To opt out of sharing your client-side telemetry and content in the Kiro IDE, use this procedure:

  1. Open **Settings** in Kiro.
  2. Switch to the **User** sub-tab.
  3. Choose **Application** , and then choose **Telemetry and Content**.
  4. To opt out of telemetry collection, uncheck the box for **Data Sharing and Prompt Logging: Usage Analytics And Performance Metrics**. To opt out of content collection, uncheck the box for **Data Sharing and Prompt Logging: Content Collection for Service Improvement**.



### Opting out of sharing data in the CLI

To opt out of sharing your client-side telemetry and content in the Kiro CLI, use this procedure:

  1. Open **Preferences** in the Kiro CLI application.
  2. To opt out of telemetry collection, toggle off the **Telemetry** setting. To opt out of content collection, toggle off the **Share Kiro content with AWS** setting.



## Types of telemetry collected

  * **Usage data** — Information such as the Kiro version, operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS), and the anonymous machine ID.
  * **Performance metrics** — The request count, errors, and latency for various features:
    * Login
    * Tab completion
    * Code generation
    * Steering
    * Hooks
    * Spec generation
    * Tools
    * MCP

Model Context Protocol (MCP) extends Kiro's capabilities by connecting to specialized servers that provide additional tools and context. This guide helps you set up, configure, and use MCP servers with Kiro.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol that allows Kiro to communicate with external servers to access specialized tools and information. For example, the AWS Documentation MCP server provides tools to search, read, and get recommendations from AWS documentation directly within Kiro.

With MCP, you can:

  * Access specialized knowledge bases and documentation
  * Integrate with external services and APIs
  * Extend Kiro's capabilities with domain-specific tools
  * Create custom tools for your specific workflows



## Setting up MCP

### Prerequisites

Before using MCP, make sure you have:

  1. The latest version of Kiro installed
  2. Any specific prerequisites for the MCP servers you want to use (listed in each server's documentation)



## Managing MCP servers

### Enabling MCP support

After creating your configuration file:

  1. Open Settings with `Cmd + ,` (Mac) or `Ctrl + ,` (Windows/Linux)
  2. Search for "MCP"
  3. Enable the MCP support setting



### Using the MCP servers tab

The Kiro panel includes an MCP servers tab that shows:

  * All configured MCP servers
  * Connection status indicators
  * Quick access to server tools



To use this feature:

  1. Select the Kiro icon in the activity bar
  2. Navigate to the MCP servers tab
  3. Click any tool name to insert a placeholder prompt in the chat



## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with MCP servers:

### Checking MCP logs

  1. Open the Kiro panel
  2. Select the Output tab
  3. Choose "Kiro - MCP Logs" from the dropdown



### Common issues and solutions

Issue| Solution  
---|---  
Connection failures| Verify prerequisites are installed correctly  
Permission errors| Check that tokens and API keys are valid  
Tool not responding| Review MCP logs for specific error messages  
Configuration not loading| Validate JSON syntax and save the config file

This guide outlines security best practices for configuring and using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with Kiro, helping you protect sensitive information and maintain system security.

## Understanding MCP security

MCP servers extend Kiro's capabilities by connecting to external services and APIs. Since all MCP servers are third-party code, this introduces potential security considerations that should be addressed:

  * **Access to sensitive information** : MCP servers may require API keys or tokens
  * **External code execution** : MCP servers run code outside of Kiro's sandbox
  * **Data transmission** : Information flows between Kiro and external services
  * **Source verification** : Review the source code and verify the server comes from a trusted source before using
  * **Isolation** : Run servers in isolated environments when possible and limit the permissions granted



## Secure configuration

### Protecting API keys and tokens

  1. **Never commit configuration files** with sensitive tokens to version control
  2. **Create tokens with minimal permissions** necessary for the MCP server to function (for example, use fine-grained personal access tokens for GitHub instead of classic tokens)
  3. **Limit access scope** to only the repositories or resources needed
  4. **Regularly rotate API keys and tokens** used in configurations
  5. **Use environment variables** when possible instead of hardcoding values



### Example: Using environment variables

Instead of hardcoding tokens in your configuration:

json
    
    
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "github": {
          "env": {
            "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    

Set the environment variable in your shell:

bash
    
    
    export GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token-value
    

### Approved environment variables

For security, Kiro only expands environment variables that are explicitly approved. Only variables in the approved list will be expanded when found in MCP config files.

When you add or modify an MCP server configuration that includes unapproved environment variables, Kiro displays a security warning popup listing the variables that need approval. You can approve them directly from the popup or manage them in settings.

To manage approved environment variables:

  1. Open Kiro settings
  2. Search for "**Mcp Approved Env Vars** "
  3. Add the environment variables you want to allow for expansion



This prevents MCP servers from accessing arbitrary environment variables on your system.

### Configuration file permissions

Restrict access to your MCP configuration files:

bash
    
    
    # Set restrictive permissions on user-level config
    chmod 600 ~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json
    
    # Set restrictive permissions on workspace-level config
    chmod 600 .kiro/settings/mcp.json
    

## Safe tool usage

### Tool approval process

  1. **Review each tool request** carefully before approval
  2. **Check the parameters** being passed to the tool
  3. **Understand what the tool will do** before approving it
  4. **Deny any suspicious requests** that don't match your current task



### Auto-approval guidelines

Only auto-approve tools that:

  1. **Don't have write access** to sensitive systems
  2. **Come from trusted sources** with verified code
  3. **Are used frequently** in your workflow
  4. **Have limited scope** of what they can access



json
    
    
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "aws-docs": {
          "autoApprove": [
            "mcp_aws_docs_search_documentation", 
            "mcp_aws_docs_read_documentation"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    

## Workspace isolation

### Using workspace-level configurations

Use workspace-level configurations for project-specific MCP servers:
    
    
    project-a/
    ├── .kiro/
    │   └── settings/
    │       └── mcp.json  # Project A specific servers
    project-b/
    ├── .kiro/
    │   └── settings/
    │       └── mcp.json  # Project B specific servers
    

This ensures that:

  * MCP servers only run when working in the relevant project
  * Tokens and configurations are isolated between projects
  * Security risks are contained to specific workspaces



## Monitoring and auditing

### Checking MCP logs

Regularly review MCP logs to monitor server activity:

  1. Open the Kiro panel
  2. Select the Output tab
  3. Choose "Kiro - MCP Logs" from the dropdown



### Auditing tool usage

Periodically review which tools you've approved:

  1. Check your MCP configuration for auto-approved tools
  2. Review the MCP logs for tool usage patterns
  3. Monitor server activity for unexpected behavior
  4. Remove auto-approval for tools you no longer use frequently



## Responding to security incidents

If you suspect a security issue with an MCP server:

  1. **Disable the server** immediately in your configuration
  2. **Revoke any tokens or API keys** associated with the server
  3. **Check for unauthorized activity** in the connected services
  4. **Report the issue** to the MCP server maintainer



## Additional security measures

### Network security

  1. **Use firewalls** to restrict outbound connections from MCP servers
  2. **Consider using a VPN** for sensitive MCP server connections
  3. **Monitor network traffic** to and from MCP servers



### System security

  1. **Keep your system updated** with security patches
  2. **Run MCP servers with minimal privileges**
  3. **Use separate user accounts** for running sensitive MCP servers

## Share your MCP server

Create one-click installation links that let users add your MCP server to Kiro instantly.

### Install link schema

**URL Format:**
    
    
    https://kiro.dev/launch/mcp/add?name=<server-name>&config=<url-encoded-config>
    

**Query Parameters:**

Parameter| Type| Required| Description  
---|---|---|---  
`name`| String| Yes| Display name for the MCP server  
`config`| String| Yes| URL-encoded JSON configuration object (see [MCP Configuration](/docs/mcp/configuration/#configuration-properties) for schema)  
  
### Generate an install link

Use these helper functions to programmatically create installation links for your MCP server. These links work universally across GitHub, web browsers, and documentation.

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**

javascript
    
    
    function createKiroInstallLink(name, config) {
      const encodedName = encodeURIComponent(name);
      const encodedConfig = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(config));
      return `https://kiro.dev/launch/mcp/add?name=${encodedName}&config=${encodedConfig}`;
    }
    
    // Example 1: Local server with command execution
    const localServerLink = createKiroInstallLink('aws-docs', {
      command: 'uvx',
      args: ['awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest'],
      env: { FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL: 'ERROR' },
      disabled: false,
      autoApprove: []
    });
    
    // Example 2: Remote server with URL endpoint
    const remoteServerLink = createKiroInstallLink('aws-knowledge', {
      url: 'https://knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws',
      disabled: false,
      autoApprove: []
    });
    
    // Example 3: Server with environment variables
    const dbServerLink = createKiroInstallLink('postgresql', {
      command: 'npx',
      args: ['-y', '@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres'],
      env: { POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING: 'postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb' },
      disabled: false,
      autoApprove: []
    });
    

**Python:**

python
    
    
    import json
    from urllib.parse import urlencode, quote
    
    def create_kiro_install_link(name: str, config: dict) -> str:
        """
        Creates a Kiro install link for one-click MCP server installation
        
        Args:
            name: Display name for the MCP server
            config: MCP server configuration dictionary
            
        Returns:
            Formatted HTTPS install link URL
        """
        encoded_name = quote(name)
        encoded_config = quote(json.dumps(config))
        return f"https://kiro.dev/launch/mcp/add?name={encoded_name}&config={encoded_config}"
    
    # Example usage
    link = create_kiro_install_link('my-server', {
        'command': 'npx',
        'args': ['-y', '@myorg/my-mcp-server'],
        'disabled': False,
        'autoApprove': []
    })
    

**Command Line (Bash):**

bash
    
    
    #!/bin/bash
    
    # Function to create Kiro install link
    create_kiro_link() {
      local name="$1"
      local config="$2"
      
      # URL encode the parameters
      local encoded_name=$(printf %s "$name" | jq -sRr @uri)
      local encoded_config=$(printf %s "$config" | jq -sRr @uri)
      
      echo "https://kiro.dev/launch/mcp/add?name=${encoded_name}&config=${encoded_config}"
    }
    
    # Example usage
    CONFIG='{"command":"npx","args":["-y","@modelcontextprotocol/server-git"],"disabled":false,"autoApprove":[]}'
    create_kiro_link "git" "$CONFIG"
    

### Add the Kiro badge

Include the `Add to Kiro` badge in your project's README or documentation to let users install your MCP server with a single click:

html
    
    
    <a href="https://kiro.dev/launch/mcp/add?name=my-server&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22...%7D">
      <img src="https://kiro.dev/images/add-to-kiro.svg" alt="Add to Kiro" />
    </a>
    

**Markdown:**

markdown
    
    
    [![Add to Kiro](https://kiro.dev/images/add-to-kiro.svg)](https://kiro.dev/launch/mcp/add?name=my-server&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22npx%22...%7D)
    

When clicked, users are prompted to open Kiro with the server configuration pre-filled. If the prompt doesn't work, the page displays the server name and a retry button.

## Configuration locations

You can configure MCP servers at two levels:

  1. **Workspace Level** : `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`

     * Applies only to the current workspace
     * Ideal for project-specific MCP servers
  2. **User Level** : `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`

     * Applies globally across all workspaces
     * Best for MCP servers you use frequently



If both files exist, configurations are merged with workspace settings taking precedence.

## Creating configuration files

### Using the command palette

  1. Open the command palette:

     * Mac: `Cmd + Shift + P`
     * Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
  2. Search for "MCP" and select one of these options:

     * **Kiro: Open workspace MCP config (JSON)** \- For workspace-level configuration
     * **Kiro: Open user MCP config (JSON)** \- For user-level configuration



### Using the Kiro panel

  1. Open the Kiro panel
  2. Select the **Open MCP Config** icon



json
    
    
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "web-search": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-bravesearch"
          ],
          "env": {
            "BRAVE_API_KEY": "${BRAVE_API_KEY}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    

## Environment variables

Many MCP servers require environment variables for authentication or configuration:

json
    
    
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "server-name": {
          "env": {
            "API_KEY": "${YOUR_API_KEY}",
            "DEBUG": "true",
            "TIMEOUT": "30000"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    

## Disabling servers temporarily

To temporarily disable an MCP server without removing its configuration:

json
    
    
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "server-name": {
          "disabled": true
        }
      }
    }
    

## Security considerations

When configuring MCP servers, follow security best practices to protect your credentials and system:

  * Use environment variable references (e.g., `${API_TOKEN}`) instead of hardcoding sensitive values
  * Never commit configuration files with credentials to version control
  * Only connect to trusted remote servers
  * Review tool permissions before adding them to `autoApprove`



For comprehensive security guidance, see the [MCP Security Best Practices](/docs/mcp/security) page.

## Troubleshooting configuration issues

If your MCP configuration isn't working:

  1. **Validate JSON syntax** :

     * Ensure your JSON is valid with no syntax errors
     * Check for missing commas, quotes, or brackets
  2. **Verify command paths** :

     * Make sure the command specified exists in your PATH
     * Try running the command directly in your terminal
  3. **Check environment variables** :

     * Verify that all required environment variables are set
     * Check for typos in environment variable names
  4. **Save configuration changes** :

     * Changes to MCP configuration apply automatically when you save the file
     * Simply save the config file (Cmd+S) and servers will reconnect

This guide explains how to effectively use Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools with Kiro to enhance your productivity and access specialized capabilities.

## Interacting with MCP tools

Once you've [configured MCP servers](/docs/mcp/configuration), you can interact with their tools in several ways:

### Direct questions

The simplest way to use MCP tools is to ask questions related to the server's domain:
    
    
    Tell me about Amazon Bedrock
    
    
    
    How do I configure S3 bucket policies?
    

Kiro automatically selects the appropriate MCP tool based on your question.

### Specific tool requests

You can request specific MCP tools by describing what you want to do:
    
    
    Search AWS documentation for information about ECS task definitions
    
    
    
    Get recommendations for AWS CloudFormation best practices
    

### Explicit context

For more control, provide explicit context to the tool picker:
    
    
    #[aws-docs] search_documentation Tell me about AWS Lambda
    

This format specifies both the server (`aws-docs`) and the tool (`search_documentation`).

## MCP tools panel

The Kiro panel includes an MCP servers tab that provides:

  * A list of all configured MCP servers
  * Connection status indicators
  * Individual tool management
  * Quick access to server tools



To access the MCP panel:

  1. Select the Kiro icon in the activity bar
  2. Navigate to the MCP servers tab
  3. View all connected servers and their available tools



### Managing individual tools

Each MCP server can expose multiple tools. You can enable or disable specific tools without affecting the entire server:

**Via the Kiro Panel:**

  1. Open the Kiro panel and navigate to MCP servers
  2. Expand a server to see its available tools
  3. Click on a tool to see options:
     * **Enable** \- Activate a disabled tool
     * **Disable** \- Temporarily disable a tool without removing the server
  4. Disabled tools show a "Disabled" label and won't be available to Kiro



**Via JSON Config:**

Use the `disabledTools` array in your MCP configuration to permanently disable specific tools:

json
    
    
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "github": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN", "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"],
          "disabledTools": ["delete_repository", "force_push", "merge_pull_request"]
        }
      }
    }
    

This is useful for:

  * **Blocking dangerous operations** (like delete or force push)
  * **Reducing tool clutter** by hiding tools you don't use
  * **Improving performance** by limiting the tools Kiro considers
  * **Enforcing team policies** when sharing workspace configurations



### Server-level actions

Right-click on a server in the MCP panel to access additional options:

  * **Reconnect** \- Restart the connection to the server
  * **Disable** \- Temporarily disable the entire server
  * **Disable All Tools** \- Disable all tools from this server at once
  * **Enable All Tools** \- Re-enable all previously disabled tools
  * **Show MCP Logs** \- View detailed logs for troubleshooting



## Tool approval process

When Kiro wants to use an MCP tool, it requests your approval first:

  1. You'll see a prompt describing the tool and its purpose
  2. Review the tool details and parameters
  3. Click "Approve" to allow the tool to run, or "Deny" to prevent it



### Auto-approving trusted tools

To avoid repeated approval prompts for tools you trust:

  1. Edit your MCP configuration file
  2. Add tool names to the `autoApprove` array:



json
    
    
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "aws-docs": {
          "autoApprove": [
            "mcp_aws_docs_search_documentation", 
            "mcp_aws_docs_read_documentation"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    

  3. Save the file (Cmd+S) to apply changes automatically



## Examples by server type

### AWS Documentation server

#### Searching documentation
    
    
    Search AWS documentation for S3 bucket versioning
    

This uses the `mcp_aws_docs_search_documentation` tool to find relevant AWS documentation.

#### Reading documentation
    
    
    Read the AWS Lambda function URLs documentation
    

This uses the `mcp_aws_docs_read_documentation` tool to retrieve and display documentation content.

#### Getting recommendations
    
    
    Find related content to AWS ECS task definitions
    

This uses the `mcp_aws_docs_recommend` tool to suggest related documentation.

### GitHub MCP server

#### Repository information
    
    
    Show me information about the tensorflow/tensorflow repository
    

This retrieves details about the specified GitHub repository.

#### Code search
    
    
    Find examples of React hooks in facebook/react
    

This searches for code matching your query in the specified repository.

#### Issue management
    
    
    Create an issue in my repository about the login bug
    

This helps you create a new GitHub issue with appropriate details.

## Advanced usage techniques

### Chaining MCP tools

You can use multiple MCP tools in sequence for complex tasks:
    
    
    First search AWS documentation for ECS task definitions, then find related content about service discovery
    

### Combining with local context

MCP tools work best when combined with your local context:
    
    
    Based on my Terraform code, help me optimize my AWS Lambda configuration using best practices from AWS documentation
    

### Using MCP tools in specs

You can use MCP tools within [Kiro Specs](/docs/specs) to enhance your development workflow:
    
    
    In the implementation phase, use AWS documentation to ensure our S3 bucket configuration follows best practices
    

## Troubleshooting tool usage

If you encounter issues when using MCP tools:

### Tool not responding

  1. Check the MCP server status in the Kiro panel
  2. Review the MCP logs for error messages
  3. Use the `Ask Kiro` feature to resolve errors



### Incorrect results

  1. Try rephrasing your request to be more specific
  2. Check that you're using the appropriate tool for your task
  3. Verify that the MCP server has the necessary permissions



### Tool not available

  1. Ensure the MCP server is properly configured
  2. Check that the server is running and connected
  3. Verify that you have the necessary permissions to use the tool



## Best practices

  * **Be specific** in your requests to get the most relevant results
  * **Start with direct questions** before using explicit tool references
  * **Auto-approve only tools** you trust and use frequently
  * **Combine MCP tools** with local context for best results
  * **Check tool parameters** before approval to ensure they're correct

In this guide, you will learn how to use Kiro by completing tasks in the [codebase](https://github.com/kirodotdev/spirit-of-kiro) for a sample video game called Spirit of Kiro.

95% of the code for Spirit of Kiro has been written by prompting Kiro. You are going to be using Kiro to fix bugs and add features to the game to complete it.

Loading image...

Spirit of Kiro is an infinite crafting game in which you can:

  1. Discover unique, randomly generated objects
  2. Utilize these items on each other via simulated interactions like "cut", "paint", "glue", "enchant". Item's combine, break apart, and change in response to these interactions.
  3. Sell your resulting creations to an AI appraiser.



Every object in the game is generated by AI. Interactions between objects are also simulated by AI. This gives Spirit of Kiro infinite replayability and potential.

In the following diagram you can see how the game's core crafting mechanic works. The player has discovered two items: a spoon, and a glass jar of vegetables. The player can use the spoon to extract a sample of the vegetables.

While the game’s core loop is complete, the game is not quite done yet. There is an [extensive roadmap for the game](https://github.com/kirodotdev/spirit-of-kiro/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP.md), full of additional ideas to build, and there a few bugs that have been left in the game on purpose so you can try out solving them using Kiro.

In this guide you will learn to use Kiro by completing a series of tasks on a `challenge` branch of the open source code for this game. Ready to get started? Let's go!

1

#### Setup

First, we ensure that you have an AWS account. We setup a Cognito user pool for authentication, build and launch the game stack using a Docker Compose file, then bootstrap DynamoDB tables. Then we verify that the game runs on your local machine:

  * [Setup dev environment and launch the game](./00-setup)



2

#### Task: Improve game homepage

We setup steering files to help Kiro understand the project. With a full understanding of the project, we put Kiro to work improving the home landing page for the game.

  * [Steering Kiro, and improving the game homepage](./01-improve-the-homepage)



3

#### Bug Fix: Physics Glitch

When we tab out of game, the physics goes haywire when tabbing back in. Can Kiro fix it?

  * [Investigating and fixing a subtle bug with physics](./02-physics-bug)



4

#### Bug Fix: Interactions Oversight

The original pass at game interactions was "vibe coded". But it looks like AI missed something. Can Kiro correct its own mistake?

  * [Fixing a complex issue across multiple files](./03-interactions-bug)



5

#### Refactor: DRY up code with Kiro

It's not just vibe coding, we do vibe refactoring here as well.

  * [Vibe refactoring is 50% of vibe coding](./04-dry-code-refactor)



6

#### New Feature: Implementing something complex

The game is currently missing email verification and password reset. We implement this relatively complex new feature across client and server.

  * [Using specifications for complex work](./05-using-specs-for-complex-work)



7

#### Automation: Managing assets with agent hooks

We identify some boilerplate asset management work that that is error prone. Fortunately Kiro agent hooks can help us automate this.

  * [Managing assets with agent hooks](./06-managing-assets-with-agent-hooks)



8

#### Extending Kiro with MCP

Not only can you make this game your own, you can also make Kiro your own, by extending its context and behaviors with Model Context Protocol (MCP).

  * [Extending Kiro with MCP](./07-extending-kiro-with-mcp)

This module assumes you have already launched the game locally, by following [the setup instructions](../00-setup).

In previous modules we:

  * [Wrote HTML and CSS to improve the homepage](../01-improve-the-homepage)
  * [Fixed a physics bug in the core of the game's physics engine](../02-physics-bug)
  * [Fixed an interactions bug through an logic refactor](../03-interactions-bug)
  * [Did a DRY refactor across many components](../04-dry-code-refactor/)



So far we've mostly done minor modifications and refactors, but what about more complex new features? Kiro is here to help with that too.

1

#### Understand the problem

You may notice that on the login page of the game there is no "Forgot Password" link. The game is using [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) for authentication, however the implementation is currently still fairly minimal.

In order to send password reset emails, Cognito requires the email to be verified, so we also need to implement email verification as well.

So we are looking at a tree of tasks that need to be completed:

  * Email verification implementation
    * Frontend client side components
    * Backend server routes and Cognito integration
  * Password reset implementation
    * Frontend client side screens
    * Backend server routes and Cognito integration



2

#### Ask for a specification

Try the following prompt in Kiro:
    
    
    I need a specification for email verification and password reset
    

Kiro will go to work collecting information about the project and designing a specification for this complex task.

3

#### Review requirements

Kiro will expand your initial ask into a detailed set of requirements based on user stories. In most cases these user stories, and the resulting requirements, will help expand vague asks and highlight edge cases that you might not have initially expected:

Loading image...

After you read through the requirements you can either provide detailed feedback on how to rewrite the requirements or you can just type something like "LGTM" in the prompt to move on.

4

#### Review design

Now Kiro will compare the existing code to the requirements and start imagining how to fit these requirements into the codebase:

Loading image...

**Tip**

In the upper right corner of the design doc you can click the "Preview" button to open a rendered copy of the design document. This will properly show the flow diagram.

The design document likely includes some example code snippets that are similar to what Kiro plans to write to solve this problem. Don't worry too much about the specifics of this code. Think of it more as pseudocode that is imagining the API. The actual implementation may end slightly different.

After you read through the design document you can either provide detailed feedback on how to rethink the design or you can just type something like "LGTM" in the prompt to move on.

5

#### Review tasks

Kiro will use the requirements and design document to plan a series of tasks to execute. Think of each of these tasks as a step along the journey towards the new feature.

Loading image...

**Tip**

The task list may not match up with your preferred order of operations when vibe coding. For example, the task list often has test development last, while you may prefer test driven development.

You can use steering files to modify Kiro behaviors. For example, try creating a file `.kiro/steering/specs.md` with instructions to always write tests first before writing code.

You can either provide feedback in the prompt to modify the task list, or type something like "LGTM" to move on.

#### Work on a task

To start working on a task, click the "Start Task" link above the task. Kiro will go to work on that task.

**Tip**

You will likely still need to review, test, and iterate on generated code for each task, even though the task list marks the task as "Task completed".

7

#### Specification as history

You may have noticed that specifications are stored under `.kiro/specs`. By design, you should commit these specification files to the repo, alongside the code.

Over time, you can accumulate a large collection of specification documents that describe the intent and design behind the code.

This will serve as a guide for future developers, as well as a reference for Kiro if it ever needs to revisit these features.

In this module you have learned two key concepts:

  * While vibe coding is fun, sometimes you need to build something a bit more complex. Then it is helpful to use Kiro specifications to plan the requirements, design the implementation, and lay out a series of steps for the implementation.
  * Steering files aren't just to teach Kiro about the project, they can also be used to modify Kiro's behavior, such as adjusting how it plans tasks.

## Setup local development environment

First, you need to launch a local copy of the game client and server, connected to an AWS account. This way, when you use Kiro to modify the codebase, you can make sure that your changes actually work.

1

#### Clone the Repository

Clone the [open source code repository](https://github.com/kirodotdev/spirit-of-kiro) and switch to the `challenge` branch:

bash
    
    
    git clone git@github.com:kirodotdev/spirit-of-kiro.git
    cd spirit-of-kiro/
    git checkout challenge
    

After you clone, check out a few key files to understand the project:

  * [`architecture.md`](https://github.com/kirodotdev/spirit-of-kiro/blob/main/docs/architecture.md) \- An overview of the architecture
  * [`appsec-overview.md`](https://github.com/kirodotdev/spirit-of-kiro/blob/main/docs/appsec-overview.md) \- Details about how specific components of the game fit together.



2

#### Prerequisite Dependencies

You'll need the following dependencies installed:

  * [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) (recommended).
  * AWS Setup:
    * An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
    * The [AWS CLI installed locally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
    * Configure [authentication to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html)
  * [AWS Bedrock model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html) to one or more of:
    * Amazon Nova Pro
    * Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7
    * Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4



3

#### Verify Dependencies

Run the dependency check script to verify everything is set up correctly:

sh
    
    
    ./scripts/check-dependencies.sh
    

Loading image...

4

#### Deploy Cognito User Pool

Deploy an Amazon Cognito user pool for authentication (available in AWS Free Tier):

bash
    
    
    ./scripts/deploy-cognito.sh game-auth
    

**Info**

You can substitute 'game-auth' with your own custom CloudFormation stack name.

Loading image...

5

#### Build and Launch

Build and launch the game stack using either Docker or Podman:

bash
    
    
    podman compose build &&
    podman compose up \
      --watch \
      --remove-orphans \
      --timeout 0 \
      --force-recreate
    

The first time you run this command it may take a couple minutes. Subsequent runs should complete in seconds.

Loading image...

**Tip**

If this is your first time using Podman, you will need to run `podman machine init && podman machine start` before using Podman.

After completion, you should see the game containers running in your container interface. The following example shows the Podman UI: Loading image...

You can use `Control + C` or `Command + C` to stop the entire stack.

**Info**

When using Podman, on some operating systems the virtual machine can experience a time desync issue on system sleep. This will cause issues with the applications ability to communicate with AWS. If you encounter this you can fix it with the following command:

sh
    
    
    podman machine ssh sudo systemctl restart chronyd.service
    

6

#### Bootstrap database

When your stack launches locally, it also launches [DynamoDB local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html), a special container that imitates the DynamoDB AWS service, but running locally on your own machine. The game is expecting several tables to be created in this DynamoDB container.

While the game stack is still running, open a new terminal and use the following commands to automatically create the necessary tables:

sh
    
    
    podman exec server mkdir -p /app/server/iac &&
    podman cp scripts/bootstrap-local-dynamodb.js server:/app/ &&
    podman cp server/iac/dynamodb.yml server:/app/server/iac/ &&
    podman exec server bun run /app/bootstrap-local-dynamodb.js
    

Loading image...

**Info**

The DynamoDB database is persisted across restarts, by saving it to the file `docker/dynamodb/shared-local-instance.db`. If you wish to clear it out or change the structure of a table, then delete this file, restart the game stack, and rerun this database bootstrap command.

7

#### Test it out

It’s time to verify that everything is working properly. Try the following command first to make sure that the game server is running locally:

sh
    
    
    curl localhost:8080
    

You should see the response `OK`

Next open your web browser and put the following address into the address bar:
    
    
    localhost:5173
    

You should see the homepage of the game client. Create an account and start playing.

## Game guide

Here are some basic things to try in the game:

  * `WASD` to move around, `E` to interact
  * Pull random items using the red "PULL" lever
  * Pick up items and carry them around with E. Throw a held item with T. Hint: Items can be thrown out the door at the bottom.
  * Carry an item to the workbench and use E to put it on the workbench. Drag items around to move them up to the tool wall on the back, or down to the working area at the bottom. Click an item on the tool wall to cast one of it's "quirks", then select one or more targets for the "quirk". Both the tool and the targets will transform based on the quirk. Get creative with this, there are near infinite possibilities, and you can make some truly bizarre things.
  * If you are smashing items or otherwise cutting or breaking them into pieces, and there are a lot of items in the working area of the workbench they will overflow and fall off onto the ground around the workbench. Try not to let the ground get too messy!
  * The chest is for storage when you have too many items.
  * When an item is thrown out the door at the bottom of the shop keeper will judge it and you'll get money for it. He likes items that are fun, unusual, in good condition, or that seem like rare collectables.
  * The computer shows items that have been discarded or given to the appraiser, both by yourself and by other players. This serves as a randomized “shop” where you can indirectly buy from other players, or buy back things you lost.

This module assumes you have already launched the game locally, by following [the setup instructions](../00-setup).

1

#### Understand the problem

Load up `localhost:5173` in your browser to see the home page. As you can see this homepage starts out very minimalistic. There are no graphics, explanations of what the game is, and there is no marketing copy. This is a perfect task for "vibe coding".

2

#### Setup Kiro steering files

But before we "vibe" we must prepare. Because this game is fairly complex, it will be very useful to prepare Kiro to properly understand what the project is, what tech it utilizes, and how to navigate the code.

Use `Control/Command + Shift + P` to open the command palette, then search for the word “Steering”. Select the option “Kiro: Generate project steering documents”

Loading image...

The Kiro agent will go to work exploring key files from the repository and creating some “steering” files that describe the project purpose, structure, and tech. These files will help guide all future runs of the agent interactions, making them faster and more accurate.

Loading image...

Take a moment to look at the `.kiro` folder that has been created. You should see a few files:

  * `product.md` \- Describes what the project is. This helps Kiro understand the big picture view of what is going on when you ask it to do something.
  * `tech.md` \- Describes all the tech used in this project. This helps Kiro stick to your existing tech choices, instead of recommending divergent options.
  * `structure.md` \- Describes key folders and areas of the project. This helps Kiro get to the right place faster when it is working.



3

#### Make some improvements

Now that the steering files are setup, try a basic “vibe coding” prompt like “I want you to make my homepage better.”

The game client is being served by Vite, so you will be able to see changes reflected in real time as Kiro makes modifications to the page.

4

#### Get creative!

Ask Kiro a question like:
    
    
    Give me 20 potential themes for a game landing page. 
    

Then ask Kiro to reimagine the landing page in that theme.

**Tip**

AI can be very imaginative, and is perfect for prototyping designs, even if you don’t yet have a solid plan in your head. Try out asking it to make the home page have different styles such as: "Apple product marketing page", "Retro", or "Startup" and/or ask for specific features that you want on the page like a "carousel", "quotes", or "animations".

In this module we learned two core concepts:

  1. Steering files help guide an AI through your project. Your first step should always be to collect and setup this basic context for the AI.
  2. AI can be very creative, and it significantly lowers the barrier to experimentation. Try out several different prototypes very quickly, then throw away takes you don't like.

This module assumes you have already launched the game locally, by following [the setup instructions](../00-setup).

In previous modules we:

  * [Wrote HTML and CSS to improve the homepage](../01-improve-the-homepage)
  * [Fixed a physics bug in the core of the game's physics engine](../02-physics-bug)
  * [Fixed an interactions bug through an logic refactor](../03-interactions-bug)
  * [Did a DRY refactor across many components](../04-dry-code-refactor/)
  * [Built a more complex feature using specifications](../05-using-specs-for-complex-work/)
  * [Setup an automation for asset management using agent hooks](../06-managing-assets-with-agent-hooks/)



Now it's time to customize Kiro itself, to adjust it's behavior for more advanced use cases. To do this, we are going to add some new abilities to Kiro via [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP).

1

#### Setup an MCP server

Kiro comes with built-in MCP support. Click the Kiro "ghost" tab and look for "MCP Servers" on the list. Click "+" to start adding an MCP server.

Loading image...

Modify the contents of the `mcp.json` file that is opened. Because this guide is using Podman throughout, we are going to run the MCP server as a container using Podman. This will help keep the MCP server isolated from our host machine:

json
    
    
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "memory": {
          "enabled": true,
          "command": "podman",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "-i",
            "--rm",
            "-v",
            "memories:/memories",
            "--env",
            "MEMORY_FILE_PATH=/memories/memory.json",
            "mcp/memory"
          ],
          "autoApprove": [
            "create_entities",
            "create_relations",
            "add_observations",
            "delete_entities",
            "delete_observations",
            "delete_relations",
            "read_graph",
            "search_nodes",
            "open_nodes"
          ]
        },
        "sequentialthinking": {
          "command": "podman",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "-i",
            "--rm",
            "mcp/sequentialthinking"
          ],
          "autoApprove": [
            "sequentialthinking"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    

This configuration adds two new MCP servers to Kiro.

The first MCP server contains tools for tracking and querying long term memories. The memories will be stored in a local Podman volume, and can therefore persist across Kiro sessions. You can even reuse these memories from outside of Kiro or bring in memories that were generated from other external sources.

The second server helps Kiro to extend it's thinking and spend more time planning prior to getting to work on a task.

2

#### Add memories to Kiro

You can now modify Kiro's behaviors to make use of the new MCP server tools.

Create a file at `.kiro/steering/behavior.md`

Put the following content into the file:

md
    
    
      Each time you start working, put a `user_request`
      type entity into the knowledge graph using the `create_entities` tool.
      After you work, add observations to that entity
      about what you did, how many files you touched, how many lines, etc.
    

Now ask Kiro to do something in the project:
    
    
    Rewrite the README.md as if it was written by a pirate.
    

Loading image...

Now you can use a followup prompt to query the knowledge graph:
    
    
    Search nodes for user_request and write me
    a commit message based on what you see
    

Example output:

md
    
    
    docs: transform README.md with pirate-themed language
    - Rewrote entire README.md in pirate style
    - Added nautical references and pirate slang throughout
    - Maintained all original information and links
    - Changed section titles to pirate-appropriate terms
    - Added humorous pirate expressions and threats
    - Preserved functionality while enhancing user experience with thematic language
    

3

#### Modify thinking behavior

Modify the file at `.kiro/steering/behavior.md`

Put the following content into the file:

md
    
    
    When planning how to do something, use the sequentialthinking tool to plan the next several steps.
    

Now try asking the chat:
    
    
    Let's do something super cool in this project

This module assumes you have already launched the game locally, by following [the setup instructions](../00-setup).

In previous modules we:

  * [Wrote HTML and CSS to improve the homepage](../01-improve-the-homepage)
  * [Fixed a physics bug in the core of the game's physics engine](../02-physics-bug)
  * [Fixed an interactions bug through an logic refactor](../03-interactions-bug)
  * [Did a DRY refactor across many components](../04-dry-code-refactor/)
  * [Built a more complex feature using specifications](../05-using-specs-for-complex-work/)



Now we are going to use Kiro to setup an automation that will help remove boilerplate work involved with coding this game.

1

#### Understand the problem

Open the file `client/src/systems/preloader-system.ts`. This file is a standalone system which ensures that all the game assets are preloaded prior to the game starting. It has a few clever features like initiating the predownload while the user is still on the authentication screen, and detecting new assets to load via server events.

But the preloader system also relies on a list of static assets that is imported from `/client/src/assets/index.ts`. The preloader system is fully decoupled from the game components themselves. This is a clean design that ensures that individual game components don't have to manually implement calls to the preloader.

However it introduces a potential issue: a developer could add a new game component, with new asset(s), and forget to add them to the list of static assets for the preloader. Let's add an automated hook that can help avoid this, while also saving the game devs some time.

2

#### Create an asset indexer hook

Click the ghost icon in your IDE sidebar to open the Kiro panel. Locate the "Agent Hooks" section and click the plus icon to start writing a new hook.

Let's use a custom prompt for the hook. You can type in natural language to describe what you want to happen. For example:
    
    
    When a file is created in the assets folder, 
    ensure that the assets folder index.ts file is
    appropriately updated
    

Loading image...

Kiro will expand your natural language query into an agent hook configuration for the behavior you described. The hook will be stored in your `.kiro/hooks` folder. It should look something like this:

Loading image...

json
    
    
    {
      "name": "Image Asset Indexer",
      "description": "Automatically adds references to newly added image files in the assets folder to the index.ts file",
      "version": "1",
      "when": {
        "type": "fileCreated",
        "patterns": [
          "client/src/assets/*.png",
          "client/src/assets/*.jpg",
          "client/src/assets/*.jpeg",
          "client/src/assets/*.gif",
          "client/src/assets/*.svg"
        ]
      },
      "then": {
        "type": "askAgent",
        "prompt": "A new image file has been added to the assets folder. Please update the index.ts file in the assets folder to include a reference to this new image. First, check the current structure of the index.ts file to understand how images are referenced. Then add an appropriate export statement for the new image file following the existing pattern. Make sure to maintain alphabetical order if that's the current convention."
      }
    }
    

3

#### Create an asset removal hook

Now that we have an example template for an agent hook, you can also create new hooks manually by just creating new files in the `.kiro/hooks` folder.

Let's try this out by cloning the asset indexer hook and editing it into an asset removal hook. Copy the existing hook and paste it as `image-asset-remover.kiro.hook` with content like this:

json
    
    
    {
      "name": "Image Asset Remover",
      "description": "Automatically removes references to newly deleted image files in the assets folder to the index.ts file",
      "version": "1",
      "when": {
        "type": "fileDeleted",
        "patterns": [
          "client/src/assets/*.png",
          "client/src/assets/*.jpg",
          "client/src/assets/*.jpeg",
          "client/src/assets/*.gif",
          "client/src/assets/*.svg"
        ]
      },
      "then": {
        "type": "askAgent",
        "prompt": "An image file has been removed from the assets folder. Please update the index.ts file in the assets folder to remove any references to this removed image."
      }
    }
    

Loading image...

You should now have two hook configurations, and two hooks showing up under "Agent Hooks" in the Kiro panel.

4

#### Test the hooks out

Drag and drop an image file into the `client/src/assets` folder. You will see the asset indexer hook go to work.

Loading image...

Then delete that asset from the folder.

Loading image...

**Tip**

To view the agent messages for a hook, click the "Task list" button at the top of chat panel and click on an active "Current Task". Or you can click the "History" button to go back and view the agent messages for a hook that has already completed.

In this module you learned how to create and configure agent hooks to help automate common tasks in your project. These hooks can be used both to save time, and increase accuracy of boilerplate tasks.

This module assumes you have already launched the game locally, by following [the setup instructions](../00-setup).

In the previous module we completed [a simple task to improve the game's home page](../01-improve-the-homepage), but this was mostly just HTML and CSS task. Let's try working with some more complex JavaScript code that is part of the game engine core.

1

#### Understand the problem

Players of the game report that sometimes game physics go haywire and items bounce really high. One player has provided the following recording:

Loading image...

2

#### Ask Kiro to investigate

Try a prompt that describes the issue in as much detail as you can:
    
    
    When something is moving or colliding, and the player tabs out then back in, the items do a tremendous bounce. Players report "items go haywire".
    

Kiro will start investigating project files, and will identify the cause. For example:

> The problem is in the physics-system.ts file. When a user tabs out and back in, the lastTimestamp value becomes stale, and when the animation frame resumes, the calculated deltaTime can be extremely large (several seconds instead of milliseconds). This large delta is then used in physics calculations, causing objects to move much farther than they should in a single frame, resulting in the "haywire" behavior.

3

#### Dig deeper

Based on your initial description, Kiro probably coded a basic fix right away. However, we aren't done yet.

Try asking Kiro:
    
    
    What other potential solutions or mitigations should I consider?
    

You may be surprised to see the AI come up with many additional potential fixes beyond what it originally implemented.

4

#### Explore even deeper

Now that you have the model into a specific latent space of exploring potential improvements to the game's physics system it is a great time to ask a question like:
    
    
    Do you see anything else that looks like it could be improved?
    

**Info**

Large language models contain an incredible breadth of knowledge. However, they require a human to push the model a bit further to unlock the true potential. Don't stop prompting on the first answer. Ask questions like "why?", "what else?", and "what then?"

In this module we learned one key AI engineering concept:

Don't just treat AI as a task solving machine. Use the AI's depth and breadth of knowledge to explore gaps in your own knowledge.

In previous modules we:

  * [Wrote HTML and CSS to improve the homepage](../01-improve-the-homepage)

  * [Fixed an interactions bug through an logic refactor](../03-interactions-bug)



Now it's time to explore a hidden truth about vibe coding. If at least half of your prompts aren't "vibe refactors" you are probably messing up.

1

#### Understand the problem

AI is very good at using example context to implement new solutions. Unfortunately, this tends to lead to a lot of duplicated code. In the previous module we started looking at the "E" prompt. It's time to take an even closer look.

Try a prompt like:
    
    
    Where is the interact prompt implemented in the components?
    

You should see that Kiro locates multiple copies of the interact prompt:

> The interact prompt is consistently implemented across multiple interactive game objects (Computer, Workbench, Chest, Garbage, GameItem, PullLever, Dispenser)

If you open these files: `Computer.vue`, `Workbench.vue`, `Chest.vue`, etc you will notice that each component has a very similar implementation of the interact prompt with similar CSS.

But then if you move the ghost around the game play area, you will also notice subtle differences. For example, the size of the pull lever's interact prompt is slightly different from the size of the workbench interact prompt.

We can improve the code by removing duplication. There's a repeated pattern here - it would be better if we refactored the interact prompt into a single component that could be shared across all these components.

2

#### Do a refactor

Let's ask Kiro to refactor this. Open a file that contains an "E" prompt such as "Chest.vue". Then try a prompt like:
    
    
    I want to DRY the "interact-prompt" into a separate component
    with standardized styles, reused across my components
    

Loading image...

**Tip**

Kiro uses your currently open files as context. Consider opening relevant files prior to sending a prompt.

3

#### Verify the results

Kiro should discover all the components that have an "interact-prompt" element and refactor them to make use of a new shared component instead:

Loading image...

Things to check for:

  * The original implementation has interact prompts with different locations relative to the parent component: above, left, right, etc. Did that get lost in the refactor?
  * There were two different approaches to ensuring that the interact prompts text stayed at an appropriate size, no matter what the screen dimension was. Which approach, if any, did the AI model choose?



**Tip**

Trust, but also verify. While AI models can do a fantastic job at refactoring, its always necessary to double check generated code to ensure that functionality did not degrade during that refactor.

4

#### Find more to do

Try asking Kiro:
    
    
    Look through my components. Do you see any things that should
    be refactored or opportunities to implement best practices?
    

**Tip**

AI models are trained via reinforcement learning to be friendly and compliant. Therefore a model will rarely, if ever, initiate criticism or question what you ask it to do. Models will do as you ask, even if what you asked was flawed.

However, you can still use AI as a code reviewer or critic by explicitly asking it to tell you what it sees wrong or in need of improvement.

In this module you have learned two key concepts:

  * Vibe coding works, but just like regular coding, it requires regular refactors. Do "vibe refactoring" as well.
  * AI won't directly contradict you or push back on your asks, but that doesn't it isn't capable of seeing the mistakes. You just need to ask it to double check the work.

## Setup local development environment

First, you need to launch a local copy of the game client and server, connected to an AWS account. This way, when you use Kiro to modify the codebase, you can make sure that your changes actually work.

1

#### Clone the Repository

Clone the [open source code repository](https://github.com/kirodotdev/spirit-of-kiro) and switch to the `challenge` branch:

bash
    
    
    git clone git@github.com:kirodotdev/spirit-of-kiro.git
    cd spirit-of-kiro/
    git checkout challenge
    

After you clone, check out a few key files to understand the project:

  * [`architecture.md`](https://github.com/kirodotdev/spirit-of-kiro/blob/main/docs/architecture.md) \- An overview of the architecture
  * [`appsec-overview.md`](https://github.com/kirodotdev/spirit-of-kiro/blob/main/docs/appsec-overview.md) \- Details about how specific components of the game fit together.



2

#### Prerequisite Dependencies

You'll need the following dependencies installed:

  * [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) (recommended).
  * AWS Setup:
    * An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
    * The [AWS CLI installed locally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
    * Configure [authentication to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html)
  * [AWS Bedrock model access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html) to one or more of:
    * Amazon Nova Pro
    * Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3.7
    * Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4



3

#### Verify Dependencies

Run the dependency check script to verify everything is set up correctly:

sh
    
    
    ./scripts/check-dependencies.sh
    

Loading image...

4

#### Deploy Cognito User Pool

Deploy an Amazon Cognito user pool for authentication (available in AWS Free Tier):

bash
    
    
    ./scripts/deploy-cognito.sh game-auth
    

**Info**

You can substitute 'game-auth' with your own custom CloudFormation stack name.

Loading image...

5

#### Build and Launch

Build and launch the game stack using either Docker or Podman:

bash
    
    
    podman compose build &&
    podman compose up \
      --watch \
      --remove-orphans \
      --timeout 0 \
      --force-recreate
    

The first time you run this command it may take a couple minutes. Subsequent runs should complete in seconds.

Loading image...

**Tip**

If this is your first time using Podman, you will need to run `podman machine init && podman machine start` before using Podman.

After completion, you should see the game containers running in your container interface. The following example shows the Podman UI: Loading image...

You can use `Control + C` or `Command + C` to stop the entire stack.

**Info**

When using Podman, on some operating systems the virtual machine can experience a time desync issue on system sleep. This will cause issues with the applications ability to communicate with AWS. If you encounter this you can fix it with the following command:

sh
    
    
    podman machine ssh sudo systemctl restart chronyd.service
    

6

#### Bootstrap database

When your stack launches locally, it also launches [DynamoDB local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html), a special container that imitates the DynamoDB AWS service, but running locally on your own machine. The game is expecting several tables to be created in this DynamoDB container.

While the game stack is still running, open a new terminal and use the following commands to automatically create the necessary tables:

sh
    
    
    podman exec server mkdir -p /app/server/iac &&
    podman cp scripts/bootstrap-local-dynamodb.js server:/app/ &&
    podman cp server/iac/dynamodb.yml server:/app/server/iac/ &&
    podman exec server bun run /app/bootstrap-local-dynamodb.js
    

Loading image...

**Info**

The DynamoDB database is persisted across restarts, by saving it to the file `docker/dynamodb/shared-local-instance.db`. If you wish to clear it out or change the structure of a table, then delete this file, restart the game stack, and rerun this database bootstrap command.

7

#### Test it out

It’s time to verify that everything is working properly. Try the following command first to make sure that the game server is running locally:

sh
    
    
    curl localhost:8080
    

You should see the response `OK`

Next open your web browser and put the following address into the address bar:
    
    
    localhost:5173
    

You should see the homepage of the game client. Create an account and start playing.

## Game guide

Here are some basic things to try in the game:

  * `WASD` to move around, `E` to interact
  * Pull random items using the red "PULL" lever
  * Pick up items and carry them around with E. Throw a held item with T. Hint: Items can be thrown out the door at the bottom.
  * Carry an item to the workbench and use E to put it on the workbench. Drag items around to move them up to the tool wall on the back, or down to the working area at the bottom. Click an item on the tool wall to cast one of it's "quirks", then select one or more targets for the "quirk". Both the tool and the targets will transform based on the quirk. Get creative with this, there are near infinite possibilities, and you can make some truly bizarre things.
  * If you are smashing items or otherwise cutting or breaking them into pieces, and there are a lot of items in the working area of the workbench they will overflow and fall off onto the ground around the workbench. Try not to let the ground get too messy!
  * The chest is for storage when you have too many items.
  * When an item is thrown out the door at the bottom of the shop keeper will judge it and you'll get money for it. He likes items that are fun, unusual, in good condition, or that seem like rare collectables.
  * The computer shows items that have been discarded or given to the appraiser, both by yourself and by other players. This serves as a randomized “shop” where you can indirectly buy from other players, or buy back things you lost.

This module assumes you have already launched the game locally, by following [the setup instructions](../00-setup).

In previous modules we:

  * [Wrote HTML and CSS to improve the homepage](../01-improve-the-homepage)
  * [Fixed a physics bug in the core of the game's physics engine](../02-physics-bug)



Both of these tasks were fairly self contained. Let's try something a bit more complicated, spanning multiple files.

1

#### Understand the problem

Players of the game report that sometimes the "E" prompt doesn't work as expected. This seems to happen when standing near walls:

Loading image...

In this recording you can see that the "E" prompt disappears even though the player is close enough to the chest and to the item.

Try asking Kiro to solve this. For example:
    
    
    Sometimes when the player is closer to the wall than to an
    interactive object like an item or the chest, then the interact
    prompt does not appear over the interactive object.
    

2

#### Think about the proposed solution

Kiro should be able to correctly identify the issue. The function which finds which object is nearest to the player is not filtering out walls, therefore when the player is close to a wall it marks the wall as the nearest object, even though the wall is not actually interactive.

Loading image...

The model has proposed to fix the bug by introducing a check to exclude objects that have a physics mass of `Infinity`. While this technically works to solve the problem in the short term, is this the best fix? What if there are non interactive objects that have a finite mass? Or what if there are objects that have an `Infinity` mass but are still interactive?

This proposed code solution is adding logic triggered by a property whose semantic meaning is not directly related to that logic. While this fix works temporarily, the overloaded behavior will absolutely break or cause subtle bugs later on.

**Tip**

When using an AI, you must stay mentally engaged. Don't just blindly accept the first AI suggestion. Think about best practices and simpler solutions that the AI might have overlooked.

3

#### Refactoring across the project

Instead of trying to treat this as a problem entirely self contained in the file `game-object-system.ts`, let's do a bigger refactor. Everywhere that game objects are created, we should probably indicate up front whether the created object is intended to be interactive.

Try a prompt like:
    
    
    In #GameObject add a new required property `interactive`.
    In #updatePlayerProximity filter out non interactive objects
    All calls to #addObject throughout the code need to set interactive to true or false
    

**Tip**

Try using `#` to bring up the context picker. You can reference types, classes, functions, and other code primitives in your prompt, increasing the accuracy of results by ensuring that the model can jump straight to looking at the right context.

Your results should look something similar to this:

Loading image...

Instead of one change, there are 22 changes spanning many files in the project. This refactor will ensure that the API for game objects contains proper semantic meaning for expressing whether an object is intended to be interactive.

The LLM will be able to utilize this semantic meaning going forward, any time it needs to implement a feature.

In this module you have learned three key concepts:

  1. Check AI generated code prior to moving on. While code may work fine today, you still need to think a few steps ahead, because the LLM is only thinking about the problem it sees right now.
  2. When prompting in Kiro, use the context picker to mention specific functions, classes, or types in your code. This enhances model context, and produces more accurate results.
  3. Naming is important. Make sure that the "API" for your code has accurate semantic meaning. Avoid overloading properties with multiple types of behavior that aren't directly related to their semantic meanings.



Let's move on to the next task:

Kiro offers a chat panel where you can interact with your code through natural language conversations. Just tell Kiro what you need. Ask questions about your codebase, request explanations for complex logic, generate new features, debug tricky issues, and automate repetitive tasks—all while Kiro maintains complete context of your project.

Loading image...

## Key features

[Contextual UnderstandingAsk questions about your entire codebase, get explanations, or request edits with full awareness of your project structure](/docs/chat/vibe/)

[Smart Intent DetectionKiro intelligently determines whether you want information or action, adapting its responses to match your workflow needs](/docs/chat/autopilot/)

[Vibe vs Spec sessionsChat sessions can be either vibe or spec sessions. Learn more about the differences between these two.](/docs/chat/vibe/)

[Dev ServersRun long-running processes in the background without blocking your workflow](/docs/chat/dev-servers/)

## Getting started

### Accessing chat

There are multiple ways to access the chat in your development environment:

  1. **Keyboard Shortcut** : Press `Cmd+L` (Mac) or `Ctrl+L` (Windows/Linux) to open the chat panel
  2. **Command Palette** : Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) and search for `"Kiro: Open Chat"`
  3. **Secondary Side Bar** : Click the Kiro chat icon toggle using `Cmd+Opt+B` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Alt+B` in the top bar on the right to open the chat panel



### Your first conversation

Once the chat panel is open:

  1. Type your question or request in natural language in the chat input
  2. Press Enter to send your message
  3. Kiro will analyze your request and respond appropriately



Example requests to get started:

**Ask about your code**
    
    
    "Explain how authentication works in this project"
    

**Generate new code**
    
    
    "Create a React component for a user profile page"
    

**Fix issues**
    
    
    "Help me fix the error in this function"
    

### Smart intent detection

Kiro intelligently analyzes your messages to understand whether you want information or action. When you ask questions like "How does this work?" or "What's the purpose of this code?", Kiro recognizes this as an information request and responds with explanations and documentation without modifying your code. When you use directives like "Create a component" or "Fix this bug", Kiro identifies this as an action request and will propose or implement the necessary code changes, execute commands, or manage files accordingly. This seamless intent recognition allows for natural conversation without requiring explicit commands to switch between information and action modes.

## Context management

Kiro's power comes from its deep understanding of your codebase context. It automatically analyzes open files in the editor, including their dependencies and structure, but you can also explicitly provide additional context.

### Context providers

Use the `#` symbol in the chat input to access context providers:

Provider| Description| Example  
---|---|---  
`#codebase`| Allow Kiro to automatically find relevant files across your project| `#codebase explain the authentication flow`  
`#file`| Reference specific files in your codebase| `#auth.ts explain this implementation`  
`#folder`| Reference a specific folder and its contents| `#components/ what components do we have?`  
`#git diff`| Reference the current Git changes| `#git diff explain what changed in this PR`  
`#terminal`| Include recent output from your active terminal and command history| `#terminal help me fix this build error`  
`#problems`| Include all problems in the current file| `#problems help me resolve these issues`  
`#url`| Include web documentation| `#url:https://docs.example.com/api explain this API`  
`#code`| Include specific code snippets in the context| `#code:const sum = (a, b) => a + b; explain this function`  
`#repository`| Include a map of your repository structure| `#repository how is this project organized?`  
`#current`| Reference the currently active file in the editor| `#current explain this component`  
`#steering`| Include specific steering files for guidance| `#steering:coding-standards.md review my code`  
`#docs`| Reference documentation files and content| `#docs:api-reference.md explain this API endpoint`  
`#spec`| Reference all files from a specific spec (requirements, design, tasks)| `#spec:user-authentication update the design file to include password reset flow`  
`#mcp`| Access Model Context Protocol tools and services| `#mcp:aws-docs how do I configure S3 buckets?`  
  
You can combine multiple context providers in a single request:
    
    
    #codebase #auth.ts explain how authentication works with our database
    

**Tip**

The `#terminal` context provider is particularly powerful for debugging and troubleshooting. When you include `#terminal` in your message, Kiro can access your recent command history, outputs, and error messages to provide targeted assistance.

**Common scenarios:**

  * **Build failures** : `#terminal My build is failing, what's the issue?`
  * **Test debugging** : `#terminal These tests aren't passing, help me understand why`
  * **Git issues** : `#terminal I'm stuck on this merge conflict`
  * **Dependency problems** : `#terminal npm install is throwing errors`



Kiro can analyze the actual terminal output, understand error patterns, and suggest specific solutions based on what happened in your terminal session. For detailed examples and best practices, see the [Terminal Integration guide](/docs/chat/terminal).

## Sessions and history

Kiro maintains conversation history within sessions, allowing for continuous context-aware interactions.

### Managing sessions

  * **Create New Sessions** : Start fresh conversations for different topics or projects. Click on `+` icon in the chat panel to start a new session
  * **Switch between Sessions** : Easily navigate between ongoing conversations through the tab switcher
  * **View History** : Access previous interactions and their outcomes through the `History` button
  * **Task Tracking** : Monitor the progress of ongoing and completed tasks through the `Task list` button



### Execution history

Kiro maintains a detailed history of sessions that includes actions taken such as code changes, commands executed, search results, file operations, and more. You can search, restore, or delete a specific session.

## What is a Vibe session?

Vibe sessions are interactive Q&A-focused sessions in Kiro that are designed for quick questions, explanations, and building projects through a more conversational approach.

### How to access

You can switch between Vibe sessions and Spec sessions using the session picker when you launch a new session. This allows you to choose the interaction style that best suits your current task.

Loading image...

### When to Vibe

  1. **Interactive Q &A Format**: Vibe sessions are optimized for back-and-forth conversations about code, allowing you to ask questions and get immediate responses.

  2. **Quick Assistance** : They're ideal for getting quick answers to coding questions, explanations of code behavior, or understanding concepts without going through a formal specification process.

  3. **Contextual Understanding** : Like other Kiro sessions, Vibe sessions leverage context providers to understand your codebase, but with a focus on explanation rather than extensive code generation.

  4. **Flexible Approach** : Vibe sessions offer a more fluid, less structured approach compared to Spec sessions, making them suitable for exploratory coding and learning.




## What is a Spec session?

A Spec session guides you through a structured approach to complex development tasks in Kiro that formalizes the software development process. It transforms high-level ideas into detailed implementation plans with systematic execution and clear tracking.

### How to access

You can switch between Spec sessions and Vibe sessions using the session picker when you launch a new session. For complex development tasks, Spec sessions provide the structure needed to ensure thorough implementation.

Loading image...

### When to Spec

  1. **Complex Development Tasks** : Use Spec sessions for building complex features, entire applications, or significant refactoring that requires careful planning and execution.

  2. **Structured Approach** : When you need a methodical, step-by-step approach to development with clear documentation of requirements and implementation details.

  3. **Team Collaboration** : For projects where multiple team members need to understand the implementation plan and track progress against specifications.

  4. **Documentation Needs** : When you want to generate detailed documentation alongside your code implementation for future reference or knowledge sharing.

## Overview

Transform your development workflow with Kiro's terminal integration. Instead of memorizing command syntax or switching between windows, describe what you want to accomplish and Kiro translates your requests into executable commands, maintains context across operations, and provides a secure approval system that keeps you in control while managing dependencies, navigating git workflows, or exploring your codebase.

## Getting started

Simply describe what you want to do in natural language. For example:

  * "Install the project dependencies"
  * "Check the git status"
  * "Find all TypeScript files in the src folder"
  * "Run the development server"



Kiro translates your request into the appropriate terminal command and asks for your approval before executing. You'll review the suggested command and choose to Modify, Reject, Run, or Run and Trust, then see the output directly in chat.

Loading image...

**Tip**

Long-running commands like [Dev Servers](/docs/chat/dev-servers) are automatically managed by Kiro, running in dedicated terminals without blocking your workflow.

## How it works

When Kiro suggests a command, you have four options:

  * **Modify** \- Edit the command before running
  * **Reject** \- Cancel execution
  * **Run** \- Execute once
  * **Run and Trust** \- Execute and trust similar commands in the future

Loading image...

## Trust commands

For security, Kiro asks for approval before running any command. You can streamline this process by configuring which commands to trust automatically.

**Warning**

The trust system puts responsibility on you to carefully configure trusted command patterns. Commands with potentially dangerous operations (like `rm -rf`) will be accepted if they match your trusted patterns.

Kiro uses simple string prefix matching to determine if a command should be automatically trusted. You can configure trusted commands in `Settings → Trusted Commands` at both the user level (global across all workspaces) and workspace level (specific to your current project).

### Exact matching

Checks for the exact base string.

If you have trusted commands list as `["npm install", "git status"]`:

Command| Result  
---|---  
`npm install`| ✅ Trusted and runs automatically  
`git status`| ✅ Trusted and runs automatically  
`npm install --save`| ❌ Requires approval (not exact match)  
`git status --short`| ❌ Requires approval (not exact match)  
  
### Partial wildcard matching

Uses `*` to match variations of a specific command.

If you have trusted commands list as `["npm install *"]`:

Command| Result  
---|---  
`npm install`| ✅ Trusted (matches "npm install *")  
`npm install --save`| ✅ Trusted (matches "npm install *")  
`npm install express`| ✅ Trusted (matches "npm install *")  
`npm run build`| ❌ Requires approval (doesn't start with "npm install ")  
`npm test`| ❌ Requires approval (doesn't start with "npm install ")  
  
### Full wildcard matching & complex commands

Uses `*` to trust any command string that starts with the specified prefix. The trust system only checks the beginning of the command string - if it matches, the entire command is trusted, including any chained commands, pipes, or redirects that follow.

If you have trusted commands list as `["npm *", "git *"]`:

Command| Result  
---|---  
`npm install`| ✅ Trusted (matches "npm *")  
`npm install --save`| ✅ Trusted (matches "npm *")  
`npm run build`| ✅ Trusted (matches "npm *")  
`npm run build | tee log`| ✅ Trusted (starts with "npm ")  
`npm install && docker build .`| ✅ Trusted (starts with "npm ")  
`git add . && git commit -m "update"`| ✅ Trusted (starts with "git ")  
`docker build .`| ❌ Requires approval (no matching prefix)  
  
### Universal trust

**Warning**

Using wildcards (*) in trusted commands is an over-permissive configuration. This automatically approves all terminal commands without review, which can pose significant security risks including data loss, system modifications, or unauthorized access. Only use wildcards if you completely trust the environment and understand all potential commands.

If you have trusted commands list as `["*"]`:

Command| Result  
---|---  
Any command| ✅ Trusted - use with extreme caution  
  
## Using terminal context

Reference recent output from your active terminal in your conversations with `#terminal`. **Important:`#terminal` always refers to the currently active/visible terminal window.** If you have multiple terminals open, make sure the terminal you want to reference is active before using `#terminal` in your chat.

This feature allows Kiro to analyze command results, debug errors, and suggest solutions based on your actual terminal session.
    
    
    #terminal analyze the error from the last npm run build
    

Kiro maintains awareness of command history and outputs, enabling:

  * **Error Analysis** \- Understanding why commands failed with specific error messages
  * **Output Interpretation** \- Explaining complex command results and logs
  * **Follow-up Actions** \- Suggesting next steps based on actual results
  * **Pattern Recognition** \- Identifying recurring issues across multiple commands
  * **Environment Debugging** \- Helping resolve system and dependency conflicts

## Overview

Dev server support allows the Kiro agent to run background processes to access long-running terminal commands and background processes. This transforms your development workflow by eliminating context switching and manual terminal management. Instead of juggling multiple terminal windows, starting servers manually, and constantly checking build output, you can ask Kiro to handle it all. Start a dev server, continue your conversation about implementing features, and ask Kiro to validate compilation—all without leaving the chat. You stay focused on building, not managing infrastructure.

## How it works

When you ask Kiro to run a long-running command, it automatically:

  1. **Creates a dedicated terminal** with a descriptive name (e.g., "Kiro: npm run dev")
  2. **Starts the process** in the background
  3. **Returns control immediately** so you can continue working
  4. **Tracks the process** so you can check its status or output anytime



Background processes run in dedicated terminals that are visible in your terminal list, show the command they're running (e.g., "Kiro: npm run dev"), and persist until you stop them or close Kiro.

## Starting a dev server

Simply ask Kiro to run a long-running command in natural language:

  * **"Start the development server"**
  * **"Run npm run watch"**
  * **"Start the webpack build watcher"**



Kiro recognizes common long-running commands and automatically manages them as background processes. The process starts immediately in a dedicated terminal, and you can continue your conversation with Kiro while it runs.

### Process reuse

If you ask Kiro to start a process that's already running (same command in the same directory), it reuses the existing process instead of creating a duplicate. This prevents multiple instances of the same server or watcher from conflicting with each other.

## Monitoring process output

You can ask Kiro to check on your background processes at any time:

  * **"Check the output of the dev server"**
  * **"What does the npm run watch process show?"**
  * **"Are there any errors in the build watcher?"**



Kiro reads the terminal output and can help you:

  * **Identify compilation errors** and suggest fixes
  * **Confirm successful startup** of servers
  * **Debug issues** by analyzing error messages
  * **Monitor progress** of long-running tasks



## Listing active processes

To see all your running background processes:

  * **"List all background processes"**
  * **"What processes are running?"**



Kiro shows you each process with its command, working directory, and current status.

## Stopping a process

When you're done with a background process:

  * **"Stop the development server"**
  * **"Terminate the npm run watch process"**
  * **"Kill all background processes"**



Kiro terminates the process and closes its terminal, cleaning up resources.

## Automating with Steering

You can configure Kiro to automatically check background processes as part of your workflow using [steering rules](/docs/steering). For example:

markdown
    
    
    # Development Workflow
    
    After making code changes:
    1. Always check the output of the `npm run dev` process
    2. Look for compilation errors or warnings
    3. If errors exist, suggest fixes before proceeding
    

This ensures Kiro validates your changes against the dev server automatically, catching errors faster.

## Combining with code diagnostics

Background processes work alongside Kiro's code diagnostics tool to give you complete validation coverage. While your dev server or build watcher catches runtime compilation issues, diagnostics surface static analysis problems like type errors and lint warnings—all in one conversation.

Ask Kiro to check both at once: **"Check the build watcher output and show me any TypeScript errors"**

This dual-layer approach means you catch issues faster without switching between terminals and your IDE's problems panel. Everything you need to validate your changes is available through chat.

## Common use cases

**Development servers** \- Keep your Next.js, React, or other framework dev server running while you code. Check output after changes to confirm successful compilation.

**Build watchers** \- Run webpack, TypeScript, or other build tools in watch mode. Validate that your changes compile without errors.

**Test runners** \- Start test watchers to get continuous feedback. Review results anytime to see which tests pass or fail.

## Troubleshooting

### Process won't start

If a background process fails to start, check the terminal output for error messages, verify the command is correct, and ensure dependencies are installed.

### Can't find process output

If Kiro can't read process output, make sure the process is still running by checking your terminal list.

### Multiple processes conflict

If you have port conflicts, list all running processes to identify duplicates and stop unnecessary ones. Kiro automatically reuses existing processes when possible.

## What is Autopilot mode?

Autopilot mode is Kiro's autonomous execution mode that allows the agent to make code changes across your codebase and complete complex tasks with minimal intervention. It's a key feature that enables Kiro to work more independently on your behalf.

## How it works

### Autopilot mode (default)

Kiro works autonomously to complete tasks end-to-end. It can create files, modify code across multiple locations, run commands, and make architectural decisions without asking for approval at each step. You maintain control through the ability to view all changes, revert everything, or interrupt execution at any time.

### Supervised mode

Kiro applies each proposed change and then presents it for your review. You can accept, reject, or request further adjustments to any changes made. This approach gives you full visibility into each modification and lets you guide the development process to maintain code quality standards.

## Switching between modes

You can toggle between Autopilot and Supervised modes at any time using the autopilot switch in the chat interface. This flexibility allows you to use the appropriate level of control for different tasks.

## When to use each mode

### Autopilot mode is best for:

  * Experienced users familiar with Kiro's capabilities
  * Repetitive or well-defined tasks
  * Projects where you want to move quickly
  * Tasks spanning multiple files or requiring several steps



### Supervised mode is best for:

  * New users getting familiar with Kiro
  * Critical or sensitive codebases
  * Learning how Kiro approaches problems
  * When you want to carefully review each change
  * Working with unfamiliar code or complex systems



You can toggle between these modes at any time based on your current needs and comfort level with the task at hand.

## Kiro's change management features

### In Autopilot mode

In Autopilot mode, Kiro works autonomously and can make multiple changes to your codebase without requiring approval for each individual action. However, you still maintain control over these changes through several key features:

  1. **View All Changes**


  * You can see a comprehensive list of all modifications made by selecting the "View all changes" option in the Chat module
  * This gives you visibility into everything Kiro has done across your codebase
  * Changes are presented in a diff view that clearly shows what was added, modified, or removed


  2. **Revert All Changes**


  * If you're not satisfied with the changes Kiro has made, you can select "Revert"
  * This will restore your files to their previous state in the filesystem locally
  * This is essentially an "undo" function for all of Kiro's modifications
  * Note that you can also revert to a [checkpoint](/docs/chat/checkpoints), which will revert both file changes as well as context additions


  3. **Interrupt Execution**


  * You can interrupt Autopilot mid-execution to regain manual control
  * This stops Kiro from making further changes if you notice something going wrong



### In Supervised mode

In Supervised mode, Kiro works step-by-step with you, applying changes and pausing for your review:

  1. **Review Changes**


  * Kiro shows you exactly what has been modified in your codebase
  * Review each change to ensure it meets your project requirements


  2. **Accept All**


  * Accept the applied changes to continue with the next step
  * Confirms that the modifications align with your expectations


  3. **Reject All**


  * Revert changes that don't meet your needs
  * Request alternative approaches or provide specific feedback for improvements

Agent hooks are powerful automation tools that streamline your development workflow by automatically executing predefined agent actions when specific events occur in your IDE. With hooks, you eliminate the need to manually request routine tasks and ensure consistency across your codebase.

## What are agent hooks?

Agent hooks are automated triggers that execute predefined agent actions when specific events occur in your IDE. Rather than manually asking for routine tasks to be performed, hooks set up automated responses to events such as:

  * Saving files
  * Creating new files
  * Deleting files



Agent hooks transform your development workflow through intelligent automation. By setting up hooks for common tasks, you can:

  * Maintain consistent code quality
  * Prevent security vulnerabilities
  * Reduce manual overhead
  * Standardize team processes
  * Create faster development cycles



Whether you're working on a small project or managing a large codebase, agent hooks help ensure that routine tasks are handled automatically and consistently, allowing you to focus on building great software.

## How agent hooks work

The agent hook system follows a simple three-step process:

  1. **Event Detection** : The system monitors for specific events in your IDE
  2. **Prompt Execution** : When an event occurs, a predefined prompt is sent to the agent
  3. **Automated Action** : The agent processes the prompt and performs the requested actions



This automation flow eliminates repetitive tasks and ensures consistency across your codebase.

## Setting up agent hooks

Creating and managing hooks is straightforward:

### Using the explorer view

  1. Navigate to the **Agent Hooks** section in the Kiro panel
  2. Click the **+** button to create a new hook
  3. Define the hook workflow using natural language in the input field
  4. Press **Enter** or click **Submit** to proceed
  5. Configure the hook settings and save



### Using the command palette

You can also use the Command Palette to navigate to the Hook UI:

  1. Open the command palette with `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux)
  2. Type `Kiro: Open Kiro Hook UI`
  3. Follow the on-screen instructions to create your hook

These examples demonstrate real-world hook implementations that you can adapt for your own projects. Each example includes the trigger type, target patterns, and complete hook instructions.

## Security pre-commit scanner

This hook helps prevent security leaks by scanning files before they're committed.

**Trigger Type:** File Save  
**Target:** `**/*`

**Hook Instructions:**
    
    
    Review changed files for potential security issues:
    1. Look for API keys, tokens, or credentials in source code
    2. Check for private keys or sensitive credentials
    3. Scan for encryption keys or certificates
    4. Identify authentication tokens or session IDs
    5. Flag passwords or secrets in configuration files
    6. Detect IP addresses containing sensitive data
    7. Find hardcoded internal URLs
    8. Spot database connection credentials
    
    For each issue found:
    1. Highlight the specific security risk
    2. Suggest a secure alternative approach
    3. Recommend security best practices
    

## Internationalization helper

This hook ensures that when you update text in your primary language file, translations are kept in sync.

**Trigger Type:** File Save  
**Target:** `src/locales/en/*.json`

**Hook Instructions:**
    
    
    When an English locale file is updated:
    1. Identify which string keys were added or modified
    2. Check all other language files for these keys
    3. For missing keys, add them with a "NEEDS_TRANSLATION" marker
    4. For modified keys, mark them as "NEEDS_REVIEW"
    5. Generate a summary of changes needed across all languages
    

## Documentation generator

This hook automatically updates documentation when code changes.

**Trigger Type:** Manual Trigger

**Hook Instructions:**
    
    
    Generate comprehensive documentation for the current file:
    1. Extract function and class signatures
    2. Document parameters and return types
    3. Provide usage examples based on existing code
    4. Update the README.md with any new exports
    5. Ensure documentation follows project standards
    

## Test coverage maintainer

This hook ensures test coverage remains high as code evolves.

**Trigger Type:** File Save  
**Target:** `src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`

**Hook Instructions:**
    
    
    When a source file is modified:
    1. Identify new or modified functions and methods
    2. Check if corresponding tests exist and cover the changes
    3. If coverage is missing, generate test cases for the new code
    4. Run the tests to verify they pass
    5. Update coverage reports
    

## Integration with MCP

Agent Hooks can be enhanced with Model Context Protocol (MCP) capabilities to extend their functionality:

  1. **Access to External Tools** : Hooks can leverage MCP servers to access specialized tools and APIs
  2. **Enhanced Context** : MCP provides additional context for more intelligent hook actions
  3. **Domain-Specific Knowledge** : Specialized MCP servers can provide domain expertise



To use MCP with hooks:

  1. [Configure MCP servers](/docs/mcp/configuration)
  2. Reference MCP tools in your hook instructions
  3. Set appropriate auto-approval settings for frequently used tools



**Use Cases:**

  * Make sure that your Figma design system is respected
  * Update ticket status after a task is done
  * Sync a database from sample files within the project folder



### Example: validate Figma design

This hook monitors HTML and CSS files and validates that they follow a Figma design using the Figma MCP.

**Trigger Type:** File Save Hook  
**Target:** `*.css` `*.html`

**Hook Instructions:**
    
    
    Use the Figma MCP to analyze the updated html or css files and check that they follow
    established design patterns in the figma design. Verify elements like hero sections,
    feature highlights, navigation elements, colors, and button placements align.

**Example: React Component Setup**
    
    
    When a new React component file is created, add:
    1. Import statements for React and necessary hooks
    2. A functional component with TypeScript props interface
    3. Export statement
    4. Basic styling if applicable
    5. A skeleton test file in the appropriate directory
    

## On file save

Trigger when files matching specific patterns are saved.

**Use Cases:**

  * Run linting and formatting
  * Update related files
  * Generate documentation
  * Run tests for changed files



**Example: Update Test Coverage**
    
    
    When a JavaScript/TypeScript file is saved:
    1. Identify the corresponding test file
    2. Update tests to maintain coverage for any new functions
    3. Run the tests to verify they pass
    4. Update any snapshots if necessary
    

## On file delete

Trigger when files matching specific patterns are deleted.

**Use Cases:**

  * Clean up related files
  * Update import references in other files
  * Maintain project integrity



**Example: Clean Up References**
    
    
    When a component file is deleted:
    1. Find all imports of this component across the codebase
    2. Remove or comment out those import statements
    3. Suggest replacements if appropriate

This guide walks you through Kiro's essential features by working with a real project. You'll learn how to use steering files, specs, hooks, and MCP servers to enhance your development workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

  * [Installed Kiro](/docs/getting-started/installation).
  * A project to work with (either an existing project or a new one)
  * Basic familiarity with your project's structure and technology stack



## Open your project

  1. **Launch Kiro** and open your project:

     * Use `File > Open Folder` to select your project directory
     * Or drag and drop your project folder into Kiro
     * Or go to the command line and run `kiro .` from your project directory
  2. **Access the Kiro Panel** :

     * Click the Kiro Ghost icon in the activity bar (left sidebar)
     * This panel provides access to all of Kiro's AI-powered features
  3. **Start a Chat Session** :

     * The chat pane should be open by default
     * This opens Kiro's conversational interface where you can interact with the AI



## Set up Steering files

Steering files provide context about your project, helping Kiro understand your codebase, conventions, and requirements.

To get started choose `Generate Steering Docs` from the Kiro pane. Kiro generates project steering documents for you stored in `.kiro/steering/` that guide Kiro's behavior. They contain information about:

  * Your product and its purpose
  * Technical stack and frameworks
  * Project structure and conventions



You can also create custom steering files by clicking the `+` button in the steering section and add things like coding standards, and workflows, and team best practices. Learn about steering [here](/docs/steering/).

## Build features with Specs

Specs transform high-level feature ideas into detailed implementation plans through three phases:

  1. **Requirements** \- User stories with acceptance criteria in EARS notation
  2. **Design** \- Technical architecture and implementation approach
  3. **Tasks** \- Discrete, trackable implementation steps



### Create your first Spec

  1. **Start a New Spec** :

     * In your chat session, click the **Spec** button
     * Choose the `+` button in the Kiro panel's Specs section
  2. **Enter a feature description** :

     * Describe your feature in natural language
     * Example: "Add a user authentication system with login, logout, and password reset functionality"
  3. **Follow the Guided Workflow** :

     * **Requirements Phase** : Kiro will help structure your requirements using EARS notation
     * **Design Phase** : Technical architecture and component design will be documented
     * **Implementation Phase** : Discrete tasks will be generated for execution



### Execute Spec tasks

Once your spec is complete:

  1. **Review Generated Tasks** in the `tasks.md` file
  2. **Execute Tasks** by clicking on individual task items
  3. **Track Progress** as tasks automatically update to "In Progress" and "Done"

## Automate workflows with Hooks

Agent Hooks eliminate manual work by automatically executing predefined actions when:

  * Files are created, saved, or deleted
  * Manual triggers are activated
  * Specific file patterns are modified



To get started:

  1. **Access Hook Creation** :

     * Navigate to the **Agent Hooks** section in the Kiro panel
     * Click the `+` button to create a new hook
  2. **Define Hook Behavior** :

     * Describe what you want automated in natural language
     * Example: "When I save a React component file, automatically create or update its corresponding test file"
  3. **Configure Hook Settings** :

     * **Event Type** : Choose from File Created, File Saved, File Deleted, or Manual Trigger
     * **File Pattern** : Specify which files should trigger the hook (e.g., `src/**/*.tsx`)
     * **Instructions** : Define the specific actions to perform

## Extend capabilities with MCP

Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows Kiro to:

  * Access specialized knowledge bases and documentation
  * Integrate with external APIs and services
  * Use domain-specific tools and utilities
  * Connect to databases and cloud services



### Set up MCP

  1. Open the Kiro panel by clicking the Kiro Ghost icon in the activity bar. First enable MCPs, and then click the edit button (pencil icon) next to MCP in the panel

  2. By default, Kiro ships with the [fetch MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/fetch) in the JSON file. Flip it to `disabled=false` to connect to it.

  3. You can also **Add any MCP Server** by asking Kiro to add a new server or editing the JSON file directly:

json
         
         {
           "mcpServers": {
             "web-search": {
               "command": "uvx",
               "args": ["mcp-server-brave-search"],
               "env": {
                 "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
               },
               "disabled": false,
               "autoApprove": ["search"]
             }
           }
         }
         




### Use MCP tools

Once configured, you can use MCP tools in several ways:

  * **Direct Questions**
    * Ask questions that leverage the MCP server's capabilities:
    * Example: `Search for the latest React 18 best practices`
  * **Explicit Tool Usage**
    * Reference specific MCP tools with the #MCP context provider
    * Example: `#[fetch] fetch` Use the web search to find examples of TypeScript generic constraints`
  * **Integration with Other Features**
    * Combine MCP with hooks and specs:
    * Example: `Create a hook that uses the web search MCP to find relevant documentation when I create new component files`



## Next steps

Now that you've experienced Kiro's core features:
